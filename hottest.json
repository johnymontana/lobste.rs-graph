Our algorithm is designed to maximize concurrent execution, with minimal  use of synchronization. Bandwidth and auxiliary storage requirements are reduced significantly, which allows for substantially better performance.\nWe have tested our algorithms using CUDA on a PC with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX280 GPU.
