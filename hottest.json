For this reason, I\r\nwant to ask you! Have you ever worked this way?\r\n\r\n- What were the main pain-points?\r\n- Which tools did you use?\r\n- Would you have done anything differently?\r\n\r\nFeel free to describe your experiences with similar setups!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ojxg8p/database_centric_backends_what_has_your","submitter_user":{"username":"ratsclub","created_at":"2022-10-31T20:00:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":91,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ratsclub-100.png","invited_by_user":"lucasew"},"tags":["ask","databases"]},{"short_id":"fcqwq0","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fcqwq0","created_at":"2023-07-31T14:59:55.000-05:00","title":"Sliding in a Type Checker","url":"https://veera.app/type_checking.html","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fcqwq0/sliding_type_checker","submitter_user":{"username":"veera","created_at":"2022-07-11T23:11:01.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"[about me](https://veera.app/about/)","is_moderator":false,"karma":45,"avatar_url":"/avatars/veera-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum"},"tags":["compilers","plt","rust"]},{"short_id":"0i5srk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0i5srk","created_at":"2023-07-30T12:08:51.000-05:00","title":"The shell and its crappy handling of whitespace","url":"https://blog.plover.com/Unix/whitespace.html","score":38,"flags":0,"comment_count":40,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0i5srk/shell_its_crappy_handling_whitespace","submitter_user":{"username":"gerikson","created_at":"2017-01-13T03:16:10.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://gerikson.com/hnlo/\r\n\r\n@gerikson@mastodon.social\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":15521,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gerikson-100.png","invited_by_user":"varjag","github_username":"gustafe"},"tags":["unix"]},{"short_id":"s7wxbj","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s7wxbj","created_at":"2023-07-31T02:23:47.000-05:00","title":"MS Paint in your terminal","url":"https://github.com/1j01/textual-paint","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s7wxbj/ms_paint_your_terminal","submitter_user":{"username":"sjamaan","created_at":"2018-08-30T05:08:17.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Scheme enthusiast and PostgreSQL fan from the Netherlands.
