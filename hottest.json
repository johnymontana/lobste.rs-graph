Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":125,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["erlang","video"]},{"short_id":"nsymer","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nsymer","created_at":"2023-01-11T22:04:21.000-06:00","title":"The yaml document from hell","url":"https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":8,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nsymer/yaml_document_from_hell","submitter_user":{"username":"carlmjohnson","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carl M.
