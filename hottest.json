Various sanitizers and runtime exploit mitigation techniques have been shown to only provide partial protection at best. Recently developed ‘safe’ programming languages such as Rust and Go hold the promise to change this paradigm by preventing memory corruption bugs using a strong type system and proper compile-time and runtime checks. Gradual deployment of these languages has been touted as a way of improving the security of existing applications before entire applications can be developed in safe languages. This is notable in popular applications such as Firefox and Tor. In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of multi-language applications. We show that because language safety checks in safe languages and exploit mitigation techniques applied to unsafe languages (e.g., Control-Flow Integrity) break different stages of an exploit to prevent control hijacking attacks, an attacker can carefully maneuver between the languages to mount a successful attack. In essence, we illustrate that the incompatible set of assumptions made in various languages enables attacks that are not possible in each language alone. We study different variants of these attacks and analyze Firefox to illustrate the feasibility and extent of this problem. Our findings show that gradual deployment of safe programming languages, if not done with extreme care, can indeed be detrimental to security.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/g8elid/cross_language_attacks","submitter_user":{"username":"lattera","created_at":"2014-05-30T07:30:38.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Cofounder of HardenedBSD, lover of most things opensource.","is_moderator":false,"karma":4825,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lattera-100.png","invited_by_user":"xmj","github_username":"lattera","twitter_username":"lattera"},"tags":["pdf","security"]},{"short_id":"7lhkoq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7lhkoq","created_at":"2022-04-19T01:31:33.000-05:00","title":"C# 11 Preview Updates - Raw string literals, UTF-8 and more","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp-11-preview-updates/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7lhkoq/c_11_preview_updates_raw_string_literals","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":15674,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["dotnet"]},{"short_id":"mzx2rj","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mzx2rj","created_at":"2022-04-18T22:57:39.000-05:00","title":"Your Service as a Functor (2014)","url":"https://kyle.marek-spartz.org/posts/2014-05-08-your-service-as-a-functor.html","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mzx2rj/your_service_as_functor_2014","submitter_user":{"username":"Corbin","created_at":"2018-10-13T21:40:32.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Secure distributed computation should not be hard.\r\n\r\nmi pu'i tavla fo lo jbobau .i mi'e la korvo","is_moderator":false,"karma":3664,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Corbin-100.png","invited_by_user":"infinisil"},"tags":["distributed"]},{"short_id":"wkntnx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wkntnx","created_at":"2022-04-18T14:00:11.000-05:00","title":"SVG passthrough precision","url":"https://bjango.com/articles/svgpassthroughprecision/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wkntnx/svg_passthrough_precision","submitter_user":{"username":"friendlysock","created_at":"2014-02-20T00:43:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"*Literally* full of ants.\r\n\r\nFriendly engineer and human being.\r\n\r\nStrong opinions held weakly, sometimes weekly.\r\n\r\n\u003e Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified and alchemised into money. \r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":37412,"avatar_url":"/avatars/friendlysock-100.png","invited_by_user":"MasonJar"},"tags":["graphics"]},{"short_id":"pxxzxs","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pxxzxs","created_at":"2022-04-18T14:16:30.000-05:00","title":"Hacking the University in a Few Steps","url":"https://fh4ntke.medium.com/hacking-the-university-in-a-few-steps-84e43e3c01a8","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pxxzxs/hacking_university_few_steps","submitter_user":{"username":"freddyb","created_at":"2017-02-02T09:12:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Security.
