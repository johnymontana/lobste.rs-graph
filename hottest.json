Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":120,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["erlang","video"]},{"short_id":"lu2a3d","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lu2a3d","created_at":"2023-01-11T07:20:47.000-06:00","title":"Image Stacks and iPhone Racks - Building an Internet Scale Meme Search Engine","url":"https://findthatmeme.com/blog/2023/01/08/image-stacks-and-iphone-racks-building-an-internet-scale-meme-search-engine-Qzrz7V6T.html","score":22,"flags":0,"comment_count":7,"description":"\u003cp\u003eThis guy builds an iPhone cluster to do OCR on memes, incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"This guy builds an iPhone cluster to do OCR on memes, incredible.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lu2a3d/image_stacks_iphone_racks_building","submitter_user":{"username":"lorn","created_at":"2019-01-22T13:48:21.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a programmer from Brazil ","is_moderator":false,"karma":59,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lorn-100.png","invited_by_user":"sneakycrow"},"tags":["api","hardware","mobile","swift"]},{"short_id":"gy7lve","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gy7lve","created_at":"2023-01-11T10:06:20.000-06:00","title":"I wrote a library for creating basic HTTP-RPC servers in Go","url":"https://github.com/martinrue/cadet","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gy7lve/i_wrote_library_for_creating_basic_http","submitter_user":{"username":"martinrue","created_at":"2020-01-24T07:39:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Making things.
