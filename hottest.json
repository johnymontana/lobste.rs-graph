[Cellulose](https://www.cellulose.ai/) is a tool that helps ML engineers understand, fine tune, and improve the inference performance of their ONNX models. With Cellulose, they can eventually resolve these issues in just hours, not weeks.\r\n\r\nPreparing ML models for production is a **very manual and time consuming process**. Unfortunately, it is also a necessary step for inference cost savings, sometimes even a hard requirement for certain fields like robotics and space tech. Today’s ML visualization tools are over 6 years old and lack basic features like integrating modern deep learning workflows.\r\n\r\nCellulose enables you to optimize and fine tune your models in a more automated fashion throughout your ML development lifecycle. We went with a product that leads with a visualizer core as so much of a ML model today is centered around the graph itself.\r\n\r\nCellulose has a bunch of utilities to help you copy specific values to the clipboard too, just in case you’d like to run offline experimental scripts with them.\r\n\r\nWe’re supporting Nvidia TensorRT as our first runtime. Under our Professional / Enterprise plans, we’ll annotate the TensorRT compatibility /  convertibility of each node in the graph.[1]\r\n\r\nWe also have an [exciting roadmap](https://docs.cellulose.ai/roadmap/overview), but more importantly, we’d like you to try it out (it’s free to start!) then we’ll make sure to make those tweaks as soon as humanly possible.\r\n\r\nI’d love the Lobsters community to give it a try.
