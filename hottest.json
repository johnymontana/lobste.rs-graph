There, I asked about layers and /u/matklad shared how he used \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e key to switch to another layer that is for arrow keys. That was a real game changer for me and improved my productivity a lot. I noticed I’m not dreading to use arrow keys anymore (they were placed at the bottom right hand row of my Moonlander and contorting my small hands). Since then, I did a couple of more improvements, but nothing significant. I’m still just observing what I do and thinking how to reduce the strain – for example, I plan to ditch the whole top row with numbers and map them to another layer, just like on the numpad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my question is: what are your productivity hacks with layers on your keyboard?
