You get a 30GB hard drive, 1GB ram, and two AMD EPYC 7B12 2250 MHz processors which is plenty for a little golang program that just serves rendered HTML from database queries. I run postgres on the same VM to keep it free. Still plenty of space memory and cpu wise. (I also use that 30 GB hard drive as a “bucket” to avoid any cloud storage fees for images, etc.) Here is a 3 min demo of the framework:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU6-BTxQoCA\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU6-BTxQoCA\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Been working on this framework for a few years.
