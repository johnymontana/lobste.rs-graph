By simpler to implement I mean fewer lines of code; if a library for garbage collection, the LOC in that library counts too. This is all all relative; it is understood that the simplest implementation with short pause times may still be pretty complex, and also in addition I will accept a little implementation complexity in exchange for a lot of performance. The criteria are:\r\n\r\n  portable, concurrent, short pause times \u003e simple implementation \u003e low memory usage \u003e fast\r\n\r\nI'm on the fence about compaction. I do want the user to be able to run programs for a long time without running out of memory. But compaction makes interop more complex. Various contemporary language implementations, such as Golang (Go) and Python have non-compacting GC and I don't hear complaints about people's programs crashing due to memory fragmentation. Is fragmentation only a theoretical issue that doesn't come up in practice -- or, do those implementations  do something complicated to avoid fragmentation?\r\n\r\nThis will be a high-level programming language with a runtime. The runtime will know where pointers are and could do things like box values and store GC metadata there, have write barriers and/or read barriers, reference count, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy not a vanilla mark-sweep collector? That can have long pause times.\r\n\r\nWhy not the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector ( https://www.hboehm.info/gc/ )? (a) it is not portable; the docs say \"Our collector is not, and cannot be, implemented as completely portable C code.\" In concurrent, incremental mode it appears to be even less portable.\r\n(b) It has many lines of code.\r\n(c) Because our runtime will know where pointers are, we do not need a conservative collector.\r\n\r\nWhat do you recommend?
