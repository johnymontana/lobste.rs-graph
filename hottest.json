Still, these methods are far less applied than expected, particularly, in critical domains where they are strongly recommended and where they have the greatest potential. Our hypothesis is that formal methods still seem not to be applicable enough or ready for their intended use. In critical software engineering, what do we mean when we speak of a formal method? And what does it mean for such a method to be applicable both from a scientific and practical viewpoint? Based on what the literature tells about the first question, with this manifesto, we lay out a set of principles that when followed by a formal method give rise to its mature applicability in a given scope. Rather than exercising criticism of past developments, this manifesto strives to foster an increased use of formal methods to the maximum benefit. “\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/k1enth/manifesto_for_applicable_formal_methods","submitter_user":{"username":"ToKi","created_at":"2018-07-14T07:16:30.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":124,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ToKi-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["formalmethods","pdf"]},{"short_id":"7eukwt","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7eukwt","created_at":"2021-12-28T00:01:39.000-06:00","title":"Using Hammerspoon to enhance and automate Bear.app on macOS","url":"https://www.zachary.com/posts/hammerspoon-and-bear/","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7eukwt/using_hammerspoon_enhance_automate_bear","submitter_user":{"username":"dcreemer","created_at":"2017-08-28T22:05:06.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":174,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dcreemer-100.png","invited_by_user":"friendlysock","github_username":"dcreemer"},"tags":["lua","mac"]},{"short_id":"qhmmtx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qhmmtx","created_at":"2021-12-27T18:27:25.000-06:00","title":"What are some impressive user interfaces you've used based on their intended purpose?","url":"","score":25,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been trying to come up with a user interface that is both novel, mostly intuitive and beautiful.

There, I asked about layers and /u/matklad shared how he used \u003ccode\u003ea\u003c/code\u003e key to switch to another layer that is for arrow keys. That was a real game changer for me and improved my productivity a lot. I noticed I’m not dreading to use arrow keys anymore (they were placed at the bottom right hand row of my Moonlander and contorting my small hands). Since then, I did a couple of more improvements, but nothing significant. I’m still just observing what I do and thinking how to reduce the strain – for example, I plan to ditch the whole top row with numbers and map them to another layer, just like on the numpad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my question is: what are your productivity hacks with layers on your keyboard?
