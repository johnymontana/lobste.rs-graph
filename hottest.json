Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":56,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["graphics","linux"]},{"short_id":"a4m4al","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a4m4al","created_at":"2023-01-08T12:52:19.000-06:00","title":"Today's date happens more frequently on Sunday than any other day of the week","url":"https://boston.conman.org//2023/01/08.1","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":7,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a4m4al/today_s_date_happens_more_frequently_on","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19075,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["math"]},{"short_id":"z4nfcx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/z4nfcx","created_at":"2023-01-08T15:42:19.000-06:00","title":"Vim ZZ and Vim zz | Do you know the difference?","url":"https://www.programmerhat.com/vim-zz/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/z4nfcx/vim_zz_vim_zz_do_you_know_difference","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19075,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["vim"]},{"short_id":"8oxi1g","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8oxi1g","created_at":"2023-01-09T00:28:00.000-06:00","title":"Reverse Engineering TikTok's VM Obfuscation (Part 2)","url":"https://ibiyemiabiodun.com/projects/reversing-tiktok-pt2/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8oxi1g/reverse_engineering_tiktok_s_vm","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19075,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["security"]},{"short_id":"v78g7m","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/v78g7m","created_at":"2023-01-09T03:21:26.000-06:00","title":"What are you doing this week?","url":"","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing this week?
