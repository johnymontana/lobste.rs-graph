They require rapid\r\ndevelopment, are highly interactive, and pose soft real-time performance constraints. While smaller games these\r\ndays have also been developed in dynamic languages\r\nsuch as Python or Lua, traditionally engines are still\r\nwritten in static languages like C++ and C, with an\r\nadditional scripting language on top to handle gameplay mechanics. Common Lisp offers an environment\r\nthat’s both dynamic and performant enough to allow\r\nfor a full stack game development system that is highly\r\nfavourable to fast iteration and modular design.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bi4312/using_highly_dynamic_language_for","submitter_user":{"username":"jmiven","created_at":"2014-04-27T18:35:23.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1207,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jmiven-100.png","invited_by_user":"kev009","github_username":"jmiven"},"tags":["games","lisp","pdf"]},{"short_id":"t2bi9l","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/t2bi9l","created_at":"2023-01-04T05:38:27.000-06:00","title":"LKRG - Linux Kernel Runtime Guard","url":"https://lkrg.org/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eLinux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) is a kernel module that performs runtime integrity checking of the Linux kernel and detection of security vulnerability exploits against the kernel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2022/12/14/1\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eLKRG 0.9.6\u003c/a\u003e (2022-12-14) - mailing list announcement of recent version\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/lkrg-org/lkrg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003elkrg-org/lkrg\u003c/a\u003e - source code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditional resources:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openwall.com/presentations/OSTconf2020-LKRG-In-A-Nutshell/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eLinux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) in a nutshell\u003c/a\u003e (2020-08-13) - presentation about version 0.8\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://openwall.info/wiki/p_lkrg/Main\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eHistorical Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) wiki\u003c/a\u003e (2020-12-17) - exploit detection examples from old versions, no longer updated\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailability (quoting lkrg.org as seen on 2023-01-04):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLKRG packages exist in \u003ca href=\"https://packages.altlinux.org/en/sisyphus/srpms/kernel-source-lkrg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eALT Linux\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lkrg-dkms/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eArch Linux\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://dl.astralinux.ru/astra/stable/orel/repository/pool/main/l/lkrg/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eAstra Linux\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://code.funtoo.org/bitbucket/projects/AUTO/repos/security-kit/browse/app-antivirus/lkrg?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fnext\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eFuntoo\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-antivirus/lkrg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eGentoo\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/lkrg/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eGuix\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable\u0026amp;from=0\u0026amp;size=50\u0026amp;sort=relevance\u0026amp;type=packages\u0026amp;query=lkrg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eNixOS\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eWhonix\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-security/tree/recipes-kernel/lkrg\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eYocto\u003c/a\u003e (and thus also \u003ca href=\"https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/plugins/gitiles/openbmc/openbmc/+/refs/heads/master/meta-security/recipes-kernel/lkrg/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eOpenBMC\u003c/a\u003e).
