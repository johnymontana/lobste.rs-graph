I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":69,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["graphics","linux"]},{"short_id":"omwbk8","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/omwbk8","created_at":"2023-01-08T09:00:21.000-06:00","title":"There Is No Software Maintenance","url":"https://henrikwarne.com/2023/01/07/there-is-no-software-maintenance/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/omwbk8/there_is_no_software_maintenance","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19081,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"mqqvlt","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mqqvlt","created_at":"2023-01-08T12:53:43.000-06:00","title":"My encounter with Medley Interlisp","url":"https://journal.paoloamoroso.com/my-encounter-with-medley-interlisp","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mqqvlt/my_encounter_with_medley_interlisp","submitter_user":{"username":"jacereda","created_at":"2016-12-21T16:33:33.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":130,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jacereda-100.png","invited_by_user":"paf31"},"tags":["historical","lisp"]}]
