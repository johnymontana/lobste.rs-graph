Examples and discussion are equally welcome.\r\n\r\nSome examples to get you going:\r\n- Ruby's [Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) gem lets you try out a new function side-by-side with using the old function, and record differences in timing and behaviour.\r\n- Simon Hørup Eskildsen's article on [Shitlist Driven Development](https://sirupsen.com/shitlists) gives a deprecated function a whitelist, so any new callers can be headed off at the pass.\r\n- Stephan Boyer's [https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical](Typical): implements a field type `asymmetric` that compiles to 'required' for producers, but 'optional' for consumers. This intermediate stage lets you safely transition a field between 'optional everywhere' to 'required everywhere', without the careful staged rollouts that manual asymmetry requires.\r\n- [this Twitter thread on process in code](https://nitter.net/evinism/status/1338684345603657730#m) between @evinism and @hwayne","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hy8xw1/what_code_constructs_express_team","submitter_user":{"username":"Sietsebb","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:32:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3095,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Sietsebb-100.png","invited_by_user":"asthasr"},"tags":["ask","plt","practices"]},{"short_id":"0lkzrk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0lkzrk","created_at":"2023-04-07T07:38:25.000-05:00","title":"What are you doing this weekend?","url":"","score":14,"flags":0,"comment_count":12,"description":"\u003cp\u003eFeel free to tell what you plan on doing this weekend and even ask for help or feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease keep in mind it’s more than OK to do nothing at all too!\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Feel free to tell what you plan on doing this weekend and even ask for help or feedback.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind it’s more than OK to do nothing at all too!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0lkzrk/what_are_you_doing_this_weekend","submitter_user":{"username":"caius","created_at":"2014-05-13T06:58:30.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Compulsive Geek, Ale Connoisseur, Occasionally Responsible Adult.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8778,"avatar_url":"/avatars/caius-100.png","invited_by_user":"lauris","github_username":"caius","twitter_username":"Caius"},"tags":["ask","programming"]},{"short_id":"9hiplp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/9hiplp","created_at":"2023-04-07T16:36:32.000-05:00","title":"Stay mainline","url":"https://brandur.org/fragments/stay-mainline","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/9hiplp/stay_mainline","submitter_user":{"username":"carlmjohnson","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carl M.
