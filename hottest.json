But what I really like is getting work done, and I theorize that, between the duck typing, the meta programming, all the things that make it what it is might make it harder for LLMs to work with it.\r\n\r\nI found a paper, [A Systematic Evaluation of Large Language Models of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13169), that judges some models on the metric perplexity for various languages, which I understand represents the ease of generating completions. I pulled out a table with their results, adding the avg and mean columns:\r\n\r\n    | Languages  | #tokens   | Average | Median  | Codex* | PolyCoder 2.7B | GPT-Neo 2.7B | GPT-J 6B | GPT-NeoX | CodeParrot |\r\n    |------------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|----------------|--------------|----------|----------|------------|\r\n    | C          | 55,333    | 5.5     | 2.69  | 2.55   | 2.33           | 3.69         | 2.82     | 2.37     | 19.23      |\r\n    | C#         | 67,306    | 3.05    | 2.35  | 1.72   | 2.58           | 2.49         | 2.2      | 2.12     | 7.16       |\r\n    | C++        | 69,627    | 3.51    | 2.67  | 1.95   | 2.99           | 2.87         | 2.47     | 2.32     | 8.48       |\r\n    | Go         | 79,947    | 3.32    | 2.04  | 1.39   | 2.57           | 2.19         | 1.89     | 1.85     | 10         |\r\n    | Java       | 65,484    | 3.23    | 2.64  | 1.94   | 2.92           | 2.78         | 2.49     | 2.47     | 6.79       |\r\n    | JavaScript | 54,620    | 3.81    | 2.9   | 2.17   | 3.06           | 3.07         | 2.73     | 2.62     | 9.23       |\r\n    | PHP        | 45,682    | 5.74    | 3.21  | 1.98   | 3.7            | 3.61         | 2.81     | 2.45     | 19.91      |\r\n    | Python     | 79,653    | 2.65    | 2.82  | 1.47   | 3.18           | 3            | 2.68     | 2.61     | 2.95       |\r\n    | Ruby       | 46,537    | 4.9     | 3.45  | 1.39   | 3.96           | 3.77         | 3.13     | 2.89     | 14.26      |\r\n    | Rust       | 107,717   | 3.84    | 3.08  | 1.96   | 3.24           | 3.3          | 2.92     | 2.92     | 8.68       |\r\n    | Scala      | 65,756    | 4.85    | 3.62  | 1.75   | 3.87           | 3.88         | 3.37     | 3.33     | 12.91      |\r\n    | TypeScript | 55,895    | 4.88    | 3.52  | 2.4    | 3.61           | 3.9          | 3.43     | 3.41     | 12.54      |\r\nTable sorted alphabetically. No conclusions implied.\r\n\r\nI wasn't surprised to see Ruby was towards the back of the pack, unfortunately. I also remember someone telling me that Google made Go super terse so they could mass-hire undergrads and then not train them too hard, and these results supports my previously unsupported prejudices, which is always nice. I like to think of ChatGPT as an enthusiastic intern. Quick to respond, but doesn't always listen.\r\n\r\nCan we identify, or I mean, guess at, any attributes of the well performing languages?
