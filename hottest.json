The surge of new hardware, particularly on mobile devices, introduces an explosive growth of device drivers in system kernels. Many such drivers are provided by third-party developers, which are susceptible to security vulnerabilities and lack proper vetting. Unfortunately, the complex input data structures for device drivers render traditional analysis tools, such as fuzz testing, less effective, and so far, research on kernel driver security is comparatively sparse.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this paper, we present DIFUZE, an interface-aware fuzzing tool to automatically generate valid inputs and trigger the execution of the kernel drivers. We leverage static analysis to compose correctly-structured input in the userspace to explore kernel drivers. DIFUZE is fully automatic, ranging from identifying driver handlers, to mapping to device file names, to constructing complex argument instances. We evaluate our approach on seven modern Android smartphones. The results show that DIFUZE can effectively identify kernel driver bugs, and reports 32 previously unknown vulnerabilities, including flaws that lead to arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wfmfou/difuze_interface_aware_fuzzing_for","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2394,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["linux","security"]},{"short_id":"mi36qm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mi36qm","created_at":"2021-10-05T14:07:32.000-05:00","title":"Asahi Linux Progress Report: September 2021","url":"https://asahilinux.org/2021/10/progress-report-september-2021/","score":28,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mi36qm/asahi_linux_progress_report_september","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":84391,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","linux","mac","reversing"]},{"short_id":"8ork0g","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8ork0g","created_at":"2021-10-05T12:06:24.000-05:00","title":"Novice Nix: Flake Templates","url":"https://peppe.rs/posts/novice_nix:_flake_templates/","score":21,"flags":1,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8ork0g/novice_nix_flake_templates","submitter_user":{"username":"NerdyPepper","created_at":"2019-03-22T10:44:20.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"i write rust","is_moderator":false,"karma":307,"avatar_url":"/avatars/NerdyPepper-100.png","invited_by_user":"icy","github_username":"NerdyPepper","twitter_username":"N3rdyP3pp3r"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"sxu6tz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sxu6tz","created_at":"2021-10-06T16:09:15.000-05:00","title":"Gazing into the VOID","url":"https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/gazing-void","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sxu6tz/gazing_into_void","submitter_user":{"username":"ajdecon","created_at":"2012-09-04T12:22:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I build supercomputers.
