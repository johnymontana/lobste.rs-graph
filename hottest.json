Short summary: word + subword embedding tables are very large. For example, if you have 2 million word embeddings and 2 million subword embeddings of 300 dimensions, the embedding table is about 4.4GiB, which is prohibitively large for many applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post describes a simple, but effective trick to compress embedding tables inspired by Bloom filters. Rather than storing and querying (sub)words explicitly, a word and its subwords are hashed. The hashes are used to index into the embedding table and the embedding is the average of these ‘hash embeddings’. Even though this leads to collisions, this multiple-hashing scheme makes it possible to use much smaller embedding tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iqjolo/compact_word_vectors_with_bloom","submitter_user":{"username":"danieldk","created_at":"2015-04-07T14:06:28.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Computational linguistics (parsing, generation, neural networks) and macOS/Fedora user.\r\n\r\nFeel free to drop me an e-mail.\r\n\r\nhttp://danieldk.eu/","is_moderator":false,"karma":2892,"avatar_url":"/avatars/danieldk-100.png","invited_by_user":"trousers","github_username":"danieldk","twitter_username":"danieldekok"},"tags":["ai"]},{"short_id":"nnbdqt","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nnbdqt","created_at":"2022-04-30T13:08:57.000-05:00","title":"GitBOM: Enabling Universal Artifact Traceability In Software Supply Chains","url":"https://gitbom.dev/resources/whitepaper/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nnbdqt/gitbom_enabling_universal_artifact","submitter_user":{"username":"df","created_at":"2019-12-17T11:43:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":753,"avatar_url":"/avatars/df-100.png","invited_by_user":"roshanravan"},"tags":["security"]},{"short_id":"0zqnvu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0zqnvu","created_at":"2022-04-29T21:00:44.000-05:00","title":"Post-Incident Review on the Atlassian April 2022 outage","url":"https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/post-incident-review-april-2022-outage","score":11,"flags":1,"comment_count":6,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0zqnvu/post_incident_review_on_atlassian_april","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":90608,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["practices"]},{"short_id":"oodeyh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oodeyh","created_at":"2022-04-30T03:25:11.000-05:00","title":"That time we unplugged a data center to test our disaster readiness","url":"https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/disaster-readiness-test-failover-blackhole-sjc","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oodeyh/time_we_unplugged_data_center_test_our","submitter_user":{"username":"deejayy","created_at":"2021-07-12T16:23:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mainly in frontend development (Angular), but went thru the last 25 years in IT.","is_moderator":false,"karma":188,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deejayy-100.png","invited_by_user":"indigo","github_username":"deejayy"},"tags":["scaling"]},{"short_id":"updihh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/updihh","created_at":"2022-04-29T13:36:15.000-05:00","title":"How to generate random number sequences (in your head) (1999)","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math/c/6BIYd0cafQo/m/Ucipn_5T_TMJ","score":29,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/updihh/how_generate_random_number_sequences","submitter_user":{"username":"hwayne","created_at":"2016-12-01T13:09:45.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a programmer in the Chicago area.
