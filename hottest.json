And that is the part that is not as widely advertised as the fact that he was opposed. Hilbert became such a giant in the field that if Hilbert said something, it was true, that’s it. Who’s going to oppose Hilbert? Brouwer had the chutzpah to oppose Hilbert. […] Hilbert was actually wrong about some of the things he said. That has given rise to this feeling that there is something deviant or contrary or incompatible between the constructive view and the traditional view, that I have hinted at when explaining Brouwer’s program. I am going to attempt to show you through several levels of deepening that that is not the case. In fact, in a certain sense, the type theory that we’ll develop is completely compatible with classical patterns of reasoning. There is no opposition there at all.

And that is the part that is not as widely advertised as the fact that he was opposed. Hilbert became such a giant in the field that if Hilbert said something, it was true, that's it. Who's going to oppose Hilbert? Brouwer had the chutzpah to oppose Hilbert. [...] Hilbert was actually wrong about some of the things he said. That has given rise to this feeling that there is something deviant or contrary or incompatible between the constructive view and the traditional view, that I have hinted at when explaining Brouwer's program.
