Currently the type of software I audit are WordPress plugins. I have more than 15yrs of experience with WordPress and in the past I could fairly easily assess a WordPress plugin’s potential security impact(s). Nowadays not so much due to the seemingly increased usage of npm packages included with these plugins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften these plugins do not include a package.json, package-lock.json nor are the javascript files readable (bundled \u0026amp; minified). This makes using npm audit near impossible. Good for production, less for audits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I can grab development files such as package.json, package-lock.json from a public repo, but in the case of so-called ‘premium’ plugins a public repo is usually absent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my question is: How do you (security) audit external software depending on npm packages?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePS: I’ve asked this question also on Hacker News.
