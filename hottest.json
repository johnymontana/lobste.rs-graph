However, unlike regular testing, PBT is not widespread in collegiate curricula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the value of PBT is not limited to software testing. The growing use of formal methods in industry, and the growth of software synthesis, all create demand for techniques to train students and developers in the art of specification writing. We posit that PBT forms a strong bridge between testing and the act of specification: it’s a form of testing where the tester is actually writing abstract specifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInquiry\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEven well-informed technologists mention the difficulty of finding good motivating examples for its use.

We also notice that such problems are readily available in the computer science pantheon of problems (e.g., many graph and sorting algorithms). We have been using these for some years now to teach PBT in collegiate courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrounding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn this paper, we describe the problems we use and report on students’ completion of them. We believe the problems overcome some of the motivation issues described above. We also show that students can do quite well at PBT for these problems, suggesting that the topic is well within their reach. In the process, we introduce a simple method to evaluate the accuracy of their specifications, and use it to characterize their common mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBased on our findings, we believe that relational problems are an underutilized motivating example for PBT. We hope this paper initiates a catalog of such problems for educators (and developers) to use, and also provides a concrete (though by no means exclusive) method to analyze the quality of PBT.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zlnp4x/using_relational_problems_teach","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2274,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["education","pdf","programming","testing"]},{"short_id":"zstc0u","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zstc0u","created_at":"2021-09-20T07:52:03.000-05:00","title":"eFlambe: A tool for rapid profiling of Erlang and Elixir applications","url":"https://github.com/spawnfest/eflambe","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zstc0u/eflambe_tool_for_rapid_profiling_erlang","submitter_user":{"username":"Stratus3D","created_at":"2016-03-12T06:29:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software Engineer building things with Erlang, Elixir, Ruby, Lua and Javascript.\r\n\r\nhttp://Stratus3D.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":265,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Stratus3D-100.png","invited_by_user":"machuga"},"tags":["erlang","performance"]},{"short_id":"0fqpwr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0fqpwr","created_at":"2021-09-20T05:42:31.000-05:00","title":"PCB Metro Map","url":"https://chaijiaxun.com/pcb-metro-map-build-log/","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0fqpwr/pcb_metro_map","submitter_user":{"username":"Leonidas","created_at":"2015-04-02T13:19:56.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1187,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Leonidas-100.png","invited_by_user":"LeahNeukirchen"},"tags":["hardware"]},{"short_id":"avzpk2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/avzpk2","created_at":"2021-09-20T07:57:44.000-05:00","title":"Monitoring for process completion in 2021","url":"https://ariadne.space/2021/09/20/monitoring-for-process-completion-in-2021/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/avzpk2/monitoring_for_process_completion_2021","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":83552,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["linux","unix"]},{"short_id":"bx339s","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bx339s","created_at":"2021-09-19T16:04:21.000-05:00","title":"Classic Console Neue","url":"https://webdraft.eu/fonts/classic-console/","score":22,"flags":1,"comment_count":4,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bx339s/classic_console_neue","submitter_user":{"username":"technetium","created_at":"2020-02-06T19:52:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"A sentient lump of a certain high-density material","is_moderator":false,"karma":2820,"avatar_url":"/avatars/technetium-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum"},"tags":["design"]},{"short_id":"fjeute","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fjeute","created_at":"2021-09-20T00:18:08.000-05:00","title":"So what is the deal with A/UX anyways?","url":"https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2021/09/19/so-what-is-the-deal-with-a-ux-anyways/","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fjeute/so_what_is_deal_with_ux_anyways","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":12317,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["historical","mac","unix"]},{"short_id":"tmifvs","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tmifvs","created_at":"2021-09-19T17:34:31.000-05:00","title":"Oh, Erlang!

Starting from a functional core language with explicit control-flow, Perceus emits precise reference counting instructions such that (cycle-free) programs are garbage free, where only live references are retained. This enables further optimizations, like reuse analysis that allows for guaranteed in-place updates at runtime. This in turn enables a novel programming paradigm that we call functional but in-place (FBIP). Much like tail-call optimization enables writing loops with regular function calls, reuse analysis enables writing in-place mutating algorithms in a purely functional way. We give a novel formalization of reference counting in a linear resource calculus, and prove that Perceus is sound and garbage free. We show evidence that Perceus, as implemented in Koka, has good performance and is competitive with other state-of-the-art memory collectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qmtiul/perceus_garbage_free_reference_counting","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2274,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["pdf","programming"]},{"short_id":"0gblwr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0gblwr","created_at":"2021-09-19T12:05:44.000-05:00","title":"Oil Has Multi-line Commands and String Literals","url":"https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/09/multiline.html","score":9,"flags":1,"comment_count":14,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0gblwr/oil_has_multi_line_commands_string","submitter_user":{"username":"andyc","created_at":"2016-11-29T12:37:37.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Working on http://www.oilshell.org/\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":6204,"avatar_url":"/avatars/andyc-100.png","invited_by_user":"flyingfisch"},"tags":["programming","unix"]},{"short_id":"1h4dcs","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1h4dcs","created_at":"2021-09-19T09:49:17.000-05:00","title":"Sidenotes In Web Design","url":"https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes","score":25,"flags":0,"comment_count":15,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1h4dcs/sidenotes_web_design","submitter_user":{"username":"jnb","created_at":"2017-01-03T17:55:45.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":313,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jnb-100.png","invited_by_user":"0"},"tags":["design","web"]},{"short_id":"tppogy","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tppogy","created_at":"2021-09-20T14:02:19.000-05:00","title":"AI Can Write Code Like Humans—Bugs and All","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-write-code-like-humans-bugs/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tppogy/ai_can_write_code_like_humans_bugs_all","submitter_user":{"username":"mempko","created_at":"2014-03-02T09:29:45.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a Free Software developer. \r\nSoftware is in a unique position to improve the world, and in a unique position to destroy it.\r\n\r\n* My [website](http://mempko.com)\r\n* My [projects](http://mempko.com/code.html)\r\n* My [github](http://github.com/mempko)\r\n* My [twitter](http://twitter.com/mempko)\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":2606,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mempko-100.png","invited_by_user":"cgrinds","github_username":"mempko","twitter_username":"mempko"},"tags":["ai","programming"]},{"short_id":"uebhbm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uebhbm","created_at":"2021-09-19T15:53:00.000-05:00","title":"impatient.nvim: Improve startup time for Neovim","url":"https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim","score":12,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uebhbm/impatient_nvim_improve_startup_time_for","submitter_user":{"username":"cjoly","created_at":"2021-09-07T11:35:23.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I’m currently working as a [software engineer](https://cj.rs/cv) at Cloudflare, where I get to work with exciting technologies like [eBPF](https://cj.rs/tags/ebpf/).
