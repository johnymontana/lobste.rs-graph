Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":50,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["graphics","linux"]},{"short_id":"7tnnbq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7tnnbq","created_at":"2023-01-08T12:17:36.000-06:00","title":"Where are my Git UI features from the future?","url":"https://blog.waleedkhan.name/git-ui-features/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7tnnbq/where_are_my_git_ui_features_from_future","submitter_user":{"username":"arxanas","created_at":"2021-10-14T16:24:40.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a software engineer who works on scalable developer tooling.","is_moderator":false,"karma":152,"avatar_url":"/avatars/arxanas-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B","github_username":"arxanas","twitter_username":"arxanas"},"tags":["rant","vcs"]},{"short_id":"6o4d2c","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6o4d2c","created_at":"2023-01-07T18:06:49.000-06:00","title":"I scanned every package on PyPi and found 57 live AWS keys","url":"https://tomforb.es/i-scanned-every-package-on-pypi-and-found-57-live-aws-keys/","score":29,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6o4d2c/i_scanned_every_package_on_pypi_found_57","submitter_user":{"username":"GeoffWozniak","created_at":"2014-03-02T15:01:50.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software developer, mostly interested in compilation, programming languages, and the history of software practices, particularly debugging techniques.
