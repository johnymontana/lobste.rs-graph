How did you choose?\r\n\r\nCheers!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sjsueq/philosophy_software_design_by_john","submitter_user":{"username":"Verdagon","created_at":"2020-07-31T04:47:19.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":320,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Verdagon-100.png","invited_by_user":"slavfox"},"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"mu41fo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mu41fo","created_at":"2023-08-23T14:49:03.000-05:00","title":"C/C++ performance pitfall: int8_t, aliasing and the ways out","url":"https://gist.github.com/alexei-zaripov/dcc14c78819c5f1354afe8b70932007c","score":28,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mu41fo/c_c_performance_pitfall_int8_t_aliasing","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":22635,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c","c++"]},{"short_id":"0yzsrt","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0yzsrt","created_at":"2023-08-23T20:16:05.000-05:00","title":"Bun v0.8.0","url":"https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v0.8.0","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0yzsrt/bun_v0_8_0","submitter_user":{"username":"beans42","created_at":"2022-04-20T01:18:00.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Second year computing student @ Queens.\r\nLooking for part-time jobs and internships :)","is_moderator":false,"karma":14,"avatar_url":"/avatars/beans42-100.png","invited_by_user":"sshaw","github_username":"beans42"},"tags":["nodejs"]},{"short_id":"p8ww7b","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/p8ww7b","created_at":"2023-08-24T10:15:25.000-05:00","title":"Effective Programming in OCaml (2021)","url":"https://youtu.be/X28PFYvZ_V8?si=ydK0LqXJGarZSY--","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/p8ww7b/effective_programming_ocaml_2021","submitter_user":{"username":"agent281","created_at":"2017-04-15T20:12:16.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3476,"avatar_url":"/avatars/agent281-100.png","invited_by_user":"numberten"},"tags":["ml","video"]}]
