BLAKE3 supports an unbounded degree of parallelism, using a tree structure that scales up to any number of SIMD lanes and CPU cores. On Intel Cascade Lake-SP, peak single-threaded throughput is 4× that of BLAKE2b, 8× that of SHA-512, and 12× that of SHA-256, and it can scale further using multiple threads. BLAKE3 is also efﬁcient on smaller architectures: throughput on a 32-bit ARM1176 core is 1.3× that of SHA-256 and 3× that of BLAKE2b and SHA-512. Unlike BLAKE2 and SHA-2, with different variants better suited for different platforms, BLAKE3 is a single algorithm with no variants. It provides a simpliﬁed API supporting all the use cases of BLAKE2, including keying and extendable output. The tree structure also supports new use cases, such as veriﬁed streaming and incremental updates.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zwuvmi/blake3_one_function_fast_everywhere","submitter_user":{"username":"snej","created_at":"2020-01-26T19:05:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mobile Architect at Couchbase.
