For workloads that frequently perform updates on\r\nmetadata (such as creating and deleting files), this improves performance by more than a\r\nfactor of two and up to a factor of 20 when compared to the conventional synchronous write\r\napproach and by 4 –19% when compared to an aggressive write-ahead logging approach. In\r\naddition, soft updates can improve file system availability by relegating crash-recovery\r\nassistance (e.g., the fsck utility) to an optional and background role, reducing file system\r\nrecovery time to less than one second.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e Categories and Subject Descriptors: C.4 [Computer Systems Organization]: Performance of\r\nSystems—Design studies; Reliability, availability, and serviceability; C.5.5 [Computer Sys-\r\ntem Implementation]: Servers; D.4.2 [Operating Systems]: Storage Management; D.4.3\r\n[Operating Systems]: File Systems Management; E.5 [Data]: Files; H.3.2 [Information\r\nStorage and Retrieval]: Information Storage","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hbuvr2/soft_updates_solution_metadata_update","submitter_user":{"username":"epilys","created_at":"2017-05-09T09:29:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1346,"avatar_url":"/avatars/epilys-100.png","invited_by_user":"river","github_username":"epilys"},"tags":["osdev","pdf","unix"]},{"short_id":"vmg80g","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vmg80g","created_at":"2022-12-07T05:12:02.000-06:00","title":"Reverse Engineering the OMNIVISION OS12D40 Driver","url":"https://serhack.me/articles/reverse-engineering-omnivision-os12d40-driver/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vmg80g/reverse_engineering_omnivision_os12d40","submitter_user":{"username":"serhack","created_at":"2020-07-21T09:01:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Security Researcher","is_moderator":false,"karma":147,"avatar_url":"/avatars/serhack-100.png","invited_by_user":"asymptotically"},"tags":["reversing"]},{"short_id":"ijra26","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ijra26","created_at":"2022-12-06T02:30:09.000-06:00","title":"honking from the console like a real honker","url":"https://x61.sh/log/2022/12/20221205T205745-honk-cli.html","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":8,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ijra26/honking_from_console_like_real_honker","submitter_user":{"username":"gonzalo","created_at":"2016-01-10T12:18:36.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"#OpenBSD #Slacker\r\n#ActivityPub: @gonzalo@honk.x61.sh\r\n#www: https://x61.sh","is_moderator":false,"karma":274,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gonzalo-100.png","invited_by_user":"jcs"},"tags":["openbsd"]},{"short_id":"mwnslf","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mwnslf","created_at":"2022-12-06T08:49:15.000-06:00","title":"Losing the magic","url":"https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/915163/ba83480903b82cb8/","score":22,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mwnslf/losing_magic","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":94365,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["historical","linux"]},{"short_id":"eolo9t","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/eolo9t","created_at":"2022-12-07T05:04:28.000-06:00","title":"Create an embedded Linux system using Buildroot","url":"https://marcocetica.com/posts/buildroot-tutorial/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/eolo9t/create_embedded_linux_system_using","submitter_user":{"username":"shah","created_at":"2019-08-14T09:26:17.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":168,"avatar_url":"/avatars/shah-100.png","invited_by_user":"guiraldelli"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"auu3eo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/auu3eo","created_at":"2022-12-06T08:45:58.000-06:00","title":"Debugging Lisp: in CL we can resume a program from any point in the stack","url":"https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/debugging-lisp-fix-and-resume-a-program-from-any-point-in-stack/","score":12,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/auu3eo/debugging_lisp_cl_we_can_resume_program","submitter_user":{"username":"vindarel","created_at":"2019-08-06T14:46:27.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Switched from Python to Common Lisp.
