Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":139,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["programming","video"]},{"short_id":"wdeoob","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wdeoob","created_at":"2023-01-18T22:43:57.000-06:00","title":"Take your pragmatism for a unicycle ride","url":"http://twitchard.github.io/posts/2023-01-18-unicycles.html","score":54,"flags":0,"comment_count":18,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wdeoob/take_your_pragmatism_for_unicycle_ride","submitter_user":{"username":"twitchard","created_at":"2017-09-07T10:51:52.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Autonomous problem-solving and entertainment system, implemented chiefly in deoxyribonucleic acid, featuring a robust natural language interface.","is_moderator":false,"karma":315,"avatar_url":"/avatars/twitchard-100.png","invited_by_user":"gg","github_username":"twitchard","twitter_username":"twitchard","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"twitchard","sig_hash":"20e54e74bc9304911ef7a85f20b7b5cdaa7572b8b706eca507080d41017bf4df0f"}]},"tags":["culture","practices","vim"]},{"short_id":"poj5zg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/poj5zg","created_at":"2023-01-20T08:17:51.000-06:00","title":"Debugging a use-after-free in gdb","url":"https://pernos.co/examples/use-after-free","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/poj5zg/debugging_use_after_free_gdb","submitter_user":{"username":"teymour","created_at":"2021-06-01T03:07:56.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"stuck in the computer nightmare","is_moderator":false,"karma":822,"avatar_url":"/avatars/teymour-100.png","invited_by_user":"bkolobara","github_username":"teymour-aldridge"},"tags":["debugging"]},{"short_id":"b75zvp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/b75zvp","created_at":"2023-01-20T08:12:25.000-06:00","title":"Backporting changes is clearly hard, which is a good reason to avoid it","url":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/BackportsAreHard","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/b75zvp/backporting_changes_is_clearly_hard","submitter_user":{"username":"technetium","created_at":"2020-02-06T19:52:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"A sentient lump of a certain high-density material.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a traditional roguelike: [GitHub](https://github.com/kiedtl/roguelike)","is_moderator":false,"karma":5004,"avatar_url":"/avatars/technetium-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum","github_username":"kiedtl"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"exun2m","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/exun2m","created_at":"2023-01-20T05:13:57.000-06:00","title":"A curated list of questions to work on a client's infrastructure / migrate applications to the cloud","url":"https://github.com/dyrector-io/awesome-infrastructure-questions","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/exun2m/curated_list_questions_work_on_client_s","submitter_user":{"username":"polaroi8d","created_at":"2023-01-11T01:18:33.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"builder / product engineer / people addict ","is_moderator":false,"karma":18,"avatar_url":"/avatars/polaroi8d-100.png","invited_by_user":"apc","github_username":"polaroi8d"},"tags":["devops"]},{"short_id":"hwf01p","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwf01p","created_at":"2023-01-19T05:59:36.000-06:00","title":"Huge Pages are a Good Idea","url":"https://www.evanjones.ca/hugepages-are-a-good-idea.html","score":23,"flags":0,"comment_count":11,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwf01p/huge_pages_are_good_idea","submitter_user":{"username":"moreati","created_at":"2018-07-11T13:06:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":75,"avatar_url":"/avatars/moreati-100.png","invited_by_user":"dw","github_username":"moreati","twitter_username":"moreati"},"tags":["linux","performance"]}]
