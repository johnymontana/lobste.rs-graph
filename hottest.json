I've tried a few, I think I'd like something that has a REPL or notebook interface as well as or instead of a file-based interface.\r\n\r\nHere are some I've tried:\r\n\r\nUsing a general-purpose programming language:\r\n\r\n- [bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) - this is quite fun, though there's quite a lot going on\r\n- [hackmud](https://www.hackmud.com/) - this seems fun and interesting, though the community is small now. This was my introduction to JS dependency hell.\r\n\r\nSpecial purpose languages:\r\n\r\n- The many Zach-likes - I've enjoyed these a lot, but I want something a bit more open than puzzle-y\r\n- Else.heart.break - This was quite fun, but a very slow start and then I broke the quest triggers by skipping right to the end of the game once I got the hacking device.\r\n- [colobot](https://colobot.info/) a cool classic educational programming game where you're an astronaut controlling lots of robots - I remember the missions feeling a lot easier to solve without much programming, but apparently there's a new mission pack...\r\n\r\nAnyway! Interested to hear your recommendations!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/i6e0xg/do_you_know_any_good_programming_games","submitter_user":{"username":"cmcaine","created_at":"2019-07-15T10:38:01.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Apprenticing scientist.\r\n\r\nCo-founding developer of Tridactyl, a popular vim-like interface to Firefox.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1588,"avatar_url":"/avatars/cmcaine-100.png","invited_by_user":"bovine3dom","github_username":"cmcaine","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"cmcaine","sig_hash":"93c29ff925d114ffbf761194337b7fc7fce40c58e7d0bf9b742cdd4978af47620f"}]},"tags":["ask","games"]},{"short_id":"v2fcp4","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/v2fcp4","created_at":"2022-10-18T15:17:19.000-05:00","title":"Sound","url":"https://ciechanow.ski/sound/","score":42,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/v2fcp4/sound","submitter_user":{"username":"adamshaylor","created_at":"2020-10-26T20:04:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1699,"avatar_url":"/avatars/adamshaylor-100.png","invited_by_user":"peterc","github_username":"adamshaylor","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"adamshaylor","sig_hash":"0ebd1a3d88d97f20922147a75889dfcae02b632d94156b9315a6d93384ae2e4f0f"}]},"tags":["science","visualization"]},{"short_id":"f2dzui","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f2dzui","created_at":"2022-10-19T08:28:10.000-05:00","title":"Yid++ the oylem’s first programming shprach","url":"https://schorrm.github.io/ypp/","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f2dzui/yid_oylem_s_first_programming_shprach","submitter_user":{"username":"yonkeltron","created_at":"2018-07-09T19:03:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://twitter.com/yonkeltron","is_moderator":false,"karma":2525,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yonkeltron-100.png","invited_by_user":"rocx","github_username":"yonkeltron","twitter_username":"yonkeltron"},"tags":["plt","satire"]},{"short_id":"w1dac5","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/w1dac5","created_at":"2022-10-18T13:21:49.000-05:00","title":"Elevator Saga - the elevator programming game","url":"https://play.elevatorsaga.com/","score":41,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/w1dac5/elevator_saga_elevator_programming_game","submitter_user":{"username":"tekknolagi","created_at":"2017-11-15T08:46:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I like compilers.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1176,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tekknolagi-100.png","invited_by_user":"akkartik","github_username":"tekknolagi"},"tags":["games","javascript"]},{"short_id":"bq7lyq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bq7lyq","created_at":"2022-10-19T15:13:34.000-05:00","title":"Non-Euclidean geometry and games (2019)","url":"https://zenorogue.scribe.rip/non-euclidean-geometry-and-games-fb46989320d4","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bq7lyq/non_euclidean_geometry_games_2019","submitter_user":{"username":"technetium","created_at":"2020-02-06T19:52:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"A sentient lump of a certain high-density material.","is_moderator":false,"karma":4757,"avatar_url":"/avatars/technetium-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum"},"tags":["games","math"]}]
