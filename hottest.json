Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":140,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["programming","video"]},{"short_id":"epwdiz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/epwdiz","created_at":"2023-01-19T06:49:21.000-06:00","title":"Gleam v0.26 released featuring incremental compilation and Deno runtime support","url":"https://gleam.run/news/v0.26-incremental-compilation-and-deno/","score":42,"flags":1,"comment_count":6,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/epwdiz/gleam_v0_26_released_featuring","submitter_user":{"username":"lpil","created_at":"2019-04-02T03:50:42.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1357,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lpil-100.png","invited_by_user":"djm","github_username":"lpil"},"tags":["erlang","javascript","release"]},{"short_id":"71zcqk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/71zcqk","created_at":"2023-01-19T14:57:24.000-06:00","title":"Funny programming languages","url":"https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/funny-programming-languages/","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":9,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/71zcqk/funny_programming_languages","submitter_user":{"username":"azhenley","created_at":"2021-10-04T14:03:32.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I work on dev tools at Microsoft.

Despite this, the construction of lattices and use of lattice reduction algorithms for cryptanalysis continue to be somewhat difficult to understand for beginners. This tutorial aims to be a gentle but detailed introduction to lattice-based cryptanalysis targeted towards the novice cryptanalyst with little to no background in lattices. We explain some popular attacks through a conceptual model that simplifies the various components of a lattice attack.\r\n\r\n[Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/032)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7vgnu7/gentle_tutorial_for_lattice_based","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95143,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["cryptography","pdf"]},{"short_id":"crc4pt","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/crc4pt","created_at":"2023-01-20T13:45:04.000-06:00","title":"Printing to stdout with an empty main","url":"https://www.cedricmartens.com/articles/empty_main","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/crc4pt/printing_stdout_with_empty_main","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":19294,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]},{"short_id":"ct1u0s","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ct1u0s","created_at":"2023-01-20T09:51:00.000-06:00","title":"Space leaks exploration in Haskell","url":"https://cs.stanford.edu/~sumith/docs/report-spaceleaks.pdf","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ct1u0s/space_leaks_exploration_haskell","submitter_user":{"username":"srid","created_at":"2019-12-15T08:34:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"My latest project: https://github.com/EmaApps/emanote","is_moderator":false,"karma":2626,"avatar_url":"/avatars/srid-100.png","invited_by_user":"Bowero","github_username":"srid","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"srid","sig_hash":"e6701544d15d41cd50cf0b336aa711802c34f53d1df4356ae74f47b9aec5c6700f"}]},"tags":["haskell","pdf"]},{"short_id":"akic3m","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/akic3m","created_at":"2023-01-19T03:00:26.000-06:00","title":"Pandoc 3.0 released","url":"https://pandoc.org/releases.html#pandoc-3.0-2023-01-18","score":70,"flags":0,"comment_count":11,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/akic3m/pandoc_3_0_released","submitter_user":{"username":"ehamberg","created_at":"2014-08-18T02:47:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://keybase.io/eh","is_moderator":false,"karma":3605,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ehamberg-100.png","invited_by_user":"oleavr"},"tags":["release"]}]
