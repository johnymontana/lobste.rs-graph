Why did they\nallow a table to have two or more columns with the same name? Why did they decide to allow\nmore than one copy of the same row to appear in a table? Why did they invent NULL and\nintroduce that third truth value, UNKNOWN?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","description_plain":"abstract:\r\n\r\n\u003e I describe the circumstances in which I obtained, in\r\n\u003e 1978, a good answer to a burning question: how can\r\n\u003e E.F. Codd’s relational model of data of 1970 [2] be\r\n\u003e properly embraced by a computer language?\r\n\u003e Considering that the answer to that question\r\n\u003e (“An Algebra of Relations for Machine\r\n\u003e Computation”) was publicly available in 1975, I\r\n\u003e wonder why it all went wrong and suggest some\r\n\u003e possible reasons.\r\n\r\nBut this paragraph on page 11 is perhaps a better abstract, or at least one that explains the title better:\r\n\r\n\u003e That situation therefore prompts us to ask, why isn’t SQL truly relational? And, given\r\n\u003e that it isn’t, why did the industry at large so readily embrace it? Well, we can easily forgive the\r\n\u003e industry at large, I suppose, because in spite of all its defects, SQL was a hugely significant\r\n\u003e advance on what we had before—its implementations did offer a fairly intuitive declarative query\r\n\u003e language without the need for loops or pointer chasing, and they did offer a modicum of physical\r\n\u003e data independence. But why didn’t its inventors come up with a truly relational language? Why\r\n\u003e did they neglect the obvious need for each of a table’s columns to have a name? Why did they\r\n\u003e allow a table to have two or more columns with the same name? Why did they decide to allow\r\n\u003e more than one copy of the same row to appear in a table? Why did they invent NULL and\r\n\u003e introduce that third truth value, UNKNOWN?","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bonajo/why_are_there_no_relational_dbmss_2015","submitter_user":{"username":"Sietsebb","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:32:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2978,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Sietsebb-100.png","invited_by_user":"asthasr"},"tags":["databases","historical","pdf"]},{"short_id":"ovdjo6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ovdjo6","created_at":"2023-03-12T07:07:44.000-05:00","title":"How To Set Default Fonts and Font Aliases on Linux","url":"https://jichu4n.com/posts/how-to-set-default-fonts-and-font-aliases-on-linux/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ovdjo6/how_set_default_fonts_font_aliases_on","submitter_user":{"username":"river","created_at":"2016-04-03T11:33:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"(Deleted account)","is_moderator":false,"karma":5228,"avatar_url":"/avatars/river-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B"},"tags":["design"]},{"short_id":"c8nqjz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c8nqjz","created_at":"2023-03-12T14:33:06.000-05:00","title":"[PADL'23] Modern Macros","url":"https://youtu.be/YMUCpx6vhZM","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"\u003cp\u003eDetails at \u003ca href=\"https://popl23.sigplan.org/details/PADL-2023-papers/20/Modern-Macros\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://popl23.sigplan.org/details/PADL-2023-papers/20/Modern-Macros\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Details at https://popl23.sigplan.org/details/PADL-2023-papers/20/Modern-Macros","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/c8nqjz/padl_23_modern_macros","submitter_user":{"username":"spdegabrielle","created_at":"2019-04-01T09:07:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Health Systems Integration developer. https://github.com/spdegabrielle https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-de-gabrielle/ https://twitter.com/spdegabrielle","is_moderator":false,"karma":267,"avatar_url":"/avatars/spdegabrielle-100.png","invited_by_user":"jkirchartz"},"tags":["lisp","video"]},{"short_id":"wswo1k","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wswo1k","created_at":"2023-03-11T21:58:40.000-06:00","title":"Macige - CI workflow generator for mobile app development","url":"https://github.com/tramlinehq/macige","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wswo1k/macige_ci_workflow_generator_for_mobile","submitter_user":{"username":"pratul","created_at":"2018-11-29T01:09:02.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I work on [tramline.app](https://tramline.app). \r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":16,"avatar_url":"/avatars/pratul-100.png","invited_by_user":"abhin4v"},"tags":["android","devops","ios"]},{"short_id":"djlgpd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/djlgpd","created_at":"2023-03-11T12:26:38.000-06:00","title":"Disambiguating Arm, Arm ARM, Armv9, ARM9, ARM64, Aarch64, A64, A78","url":"https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2023/03/10/disambiguating-arm/","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/djlgpd/disambiguating_arm_arm_arm_armv9_arm9","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96006,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["assembly"]},{"short_id":"zjghwo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zjghwo","created_at":"2023-03-11T09:33:08.000-06:00","title":"Weird – Websites as the atomic matter of the internet","url":"https://blog.erlend.sh/weird-web-pages","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zjghwo/weird_websites_as_atomic_matter_internet","submitter_user":{"username":"erlend_sh","created_at":"2015-09-08T12:07:37.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Open source enthusiast.
