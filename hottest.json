If this command is\r\nfast, all the better, since it'll run up to log_2(N)+2 times to check through\r\n$N$ commits.\r\n\r\nAt this point you can run `/path/to/bisect.bash COMMAND /path/to/commits.txt` to\r\nfind the first offending commit.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example of this, I wrote `bisect.bash` to bump nixpkgs in\r\npoetry2nix, since `HEAD` of nixpkgs `master` was breaking the `nixops` package\r\nbuild. To figure out which commit broke things, starting from the `HEAD` of the\r\ndefault branch in all the repos:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cd /path/to/poetry2nix\r\n$ good=\"$(jq --raw-output .nixpkgs.rev nix/sources.json)\"\r\n$ cd /path/to/nixpkgs\r\n$ git log --format=%H --reverse \"$good\".. \u003e commits.txt\r\n$ cd -\r\n$ /path/to/bisect/bisect.bash 'niv update --rev=\"$ENTRY\" nixpkgs \u0026\u0026 nix-build --attr nixops tests/default.nix' /path/to/nixpkgs/commits.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter building 15 out of the 32,683 commits in that range, the command finished\r\nsuccessfully, determining that commit ceab3fb5f4ae430845e93c457b5353dc8b019e2b\r\nof nixpkgs broke the nixops build in poetry2nix.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lkwafd/bisect","submitter_user":{"username":"l0b0","created_at":"2022-02-14T02:54:31.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Open source developer.","is_moderator":false,"karma":758,"avatar_url":"/avatars/l0b0-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"l0b0"},"tags":["linux","programming","show"]},{"short_id":"q1hzen","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/q1hzen","created_at":"2023-03-24T03:19:15.000-05:00","title":"Implementing multi-file analysis for linters","url":"https://jfmengels.net/multi-file-analysis/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/q1hzen/implementing_multi_file_analysis_for","submitter_user":{"username":"jfmengels","created_at":"2020-10-03T11:24:25.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm into functional programming and mostly the Elm language.
