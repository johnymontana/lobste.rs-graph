I enjoy being able to help people and in more cynical moments it’s felt like the only thing I do in my job that’s having any kind of positive impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately though I’ve been thinking that mentoring less experienced devs in whatever company I’m with at the moment is great, but in some sense folks that have gotten through education (be it college or some kind of bootcamp thing) aren’t the people that could benefit from mentorship the most, given they’re already in the industry and often have access to plenty of other forms of membership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was a teenager struggling to stand up a fansite or scratching my head over stack traces I was really lucky to have a technical mentor, just someone I had met on a forum, who took the time now and then to point me in the right direction. They really didn’t invest a ton, just took the time to explain why I didn’t need the latest and greatest stack or a distributed database, explained that the mysterious dollar sign I saw everywhere actually meant “jquery”, stuff like that. But it was amazingly helpful to me and I owe this random person who took some time out of their day to help me now and then for helping me get to where I am. I’d love to be able to pay that forward in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo question here is if any crustaceans have experience with this kind of “pro bono” mentorship, and if so do you find it rewarding? What channels are there for offering this kind of mentorship? I searched around a bit and found plenty of services that seem a lot like paid tutoring, but that’s definitely not what I’m looking for, I never would have had access to something like that when I needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mw0xd7/providing_mentorship_outside_workplace","submitter_user":{"username":"Lanny","created_at":"2014-04-02T17:26:12.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":262,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Lanny-100.png","invited_by_user":"kev009"},"tags":["ask","education"]},{"short_id":"ucvsxl","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ucvsxl","created_at":"2022-01-05T03:18:50.000-06:00","title":"Understanding UUIDs, ULIDs and String Representations","url":"https://sudhir.io/uuids-ulids","score":15,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ucvsxl/understanding_uuids_ulids_string","submitter_user":{"username":"knl","created_at":"2017-07-21T07:12:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Senior software engineer specialized in distributed systems and low latency, high frequency trading infrastructure.","is_moderator":false,"karma":4349,"avatar_url":"/avatars/knl-100.png","invited_by_user":"james","github_username":"knl","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"knl","sig_hash":"cb1fe17fead6d360f9abca902132b2407ee736f1a243f615ad9757dfe8d17e3b0f"}]},"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"zwp9ys","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zwp9ys","created_at":"2022-01-05T01:57:28.000-06:00","title":"Evaluating SvelteKit for Full-Stack Web App Development","url":"https://cprimozic.net/blog/trying-out-sveltekit/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zwp9ys/evaluating_sveltekit_for_full_stack_web","submitter_user":{"username":"Ameo","created_at":"2017-07-03T15:13:43.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a programmer.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in a bunch of stuff: Generative art, autonomous systems, low-level optimization, web development, etc. ","is_moderator":false,"karma":401,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Ameo-100.png","invited_by_user":"friendlysock","github_username":"Ameobea","twitter_username":"Ameobea10"},"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"s8joj1","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s8joj1","created_at":"2022-01-04T15:38:54.000-06:00","title":"Programming in 1987 Versus Today","url":"https://ovid.github.io/blog/programming-in-1987-versus-today.html","score":36,"flags":0,"comment_count":15,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s8joj1/programming_1987_versus_today","submitter_user":{"username":"yonkeltron","created_at":"2018-07-09T19:03:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://twitter.com/yonkeltron","is_moderator":false,"karma":1828,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yonkeltron-100.png","invited_by_user":"rocx","github_username":"yonkeltron","twitter_username":"yonkeltron"},"tags":["historical","perl"]},{"short_id":"2btkdu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2btkdu","created_at":"2022-01-05T09:30:54.000-06:00","title":"Favor real dependencies for unit testing","url":"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/03/favor-real-dependencies-for-unit-testing/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":6,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2btkdu/favor_real_dependencies_for_unit_testing","submitter_user":{"username":"clemherreman","created_at":"2019-04-16T10:37:29.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Lead backend developer @ speechi.net, France.\r\nMainly PHP \u0026 Symfony expert, some devops skills too.","is_moderator":false,"karma":286,"avatar_url":"/avatars/clemherreman-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum","github_username":"clemherreman","twitter_username":"clemherreman"},"tags":["testing"]},{"short_id":"hwzaii","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwzaii","created_at":"2022-01-05T12:02:47.000-06:00","title":"Neural Network From Scratch","url":"https://sirupsen.com/napkin/neural-net","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwzaii/neural_network_from_scratch","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Dad.
