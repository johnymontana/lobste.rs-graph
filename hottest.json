CHERI-RISC-V has replaced CHERI-MIPS as the primary reference platform, and CHERI-MIPS has been removed from the specification. CHERI architectures now always use merged register files where existing general-purpose registers are extended to support capabilities. CHERI architectures have adopted two design decisions from Arm Morello: 1) CHERI architectures now clear tags rather than raising exceptions if an instruction attempts a non-monotonic modification of a capability; and 2) DDC and PCC no longer relocate legacy memory accesses by default. CHERI-RISC-V has received numerous updates to serve as a better baseline for an upstream standard proposal including a more mature definition of compressed instructions in capability mode. CHERI-x86- 64 now includes details of extensions to existing x86 instructions and proposed new instructions in a separate ISA reference chapter along with various other updates.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rlkuts/cheri_instruction_set_architecture","submitter_user":{"username":"nwf","created_at":"2023-07-14T10:31:17.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Computer architecture, operating systems, and programming languages weenie.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1,"avatar_url":"/avatars/nwf-100.png","invited_by_user":"david_chisnall"},"tags":["hardware","pdf","release"]},{"short_id":"dkfkva","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dkfkva","created_at":"2023-09-21T10:45:06.000-05:00","title":"State of HTML 2023","url":"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dkfkva/state_html_2023","submitter_user":{"username":"dz4k","created_at":"2022-12-21T15:27:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm https://denizaksimsek.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":474,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dz4k-100.png","invited_by_user":"1cg","github_username":"dz4k"},"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"fu1pir","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fu1pir","created_at":"2023-09-21T06:44:32.000-05:00","title":"A Heat Map Reporter for Minitest","url":"https://garrettdimon.com/journal/posts/a-heat-map-reporter-for-minitest","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fu1pir/heat_map_reporter_for_minitest","submitter_user":{"username":"pushcx","created_at":"2012-08-14T20:25:08.000-05:00","is_admin":true,"about":"Hi, I'm [Peter Bhat Harkins](https://malaprop.org), a programmer and entrepreneur from Chicago.
