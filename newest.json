(previously: Cornwall, Copenhagen, Santa Cruz, Atlanta, ...).\r\n\r\nWebsite: [kmjn.org](http://www.kmjn.org/)","is_moderator":false,"karma":6777,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mjn-100.png","invited_by_user":"itistoday","twitter_username":"mm_jj_nn"},"tags":["compsci","games"]},{"short_id":"oncz0o","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oncz0o","created_at":"2023-09-12T00:31:00.000-05:00","title":"The roots of an obscure Bourne shell error message","url":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/BourneShellObscureErrorRoots","score":20,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oncz0o/roots_obscure_bourne_shell_error_message","submitter_user":{"username":"knl","created_at":"2017-07-21T07:12:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Senior software engineer specialized in distributed systems and low latency, high frequency trading infrastructure.","is_moderator":false,"karma":7418,"avatar_url":"/avatars/knl-100.png","invited_by_user":"james","github_username":"knl","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"knl","sig_hash":"cb1fe17fead6d360f9abca902132b2407ee736f1a243f615ad9757dfe8d17e3b0f"}]},"tags":["unix"]}]
