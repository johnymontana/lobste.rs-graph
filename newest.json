In October 2017 I became the site administrator after the site creator @jcs stepped down.\r\n\r\n * Please don’t message me for an invitation if we're complete strangers; check \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/u\"\u003ethe user list\u003c/a\u003e for someone you know or ask [in chat](https://lobste.rs/chat).\r\n * Submit a [`meta`](https://lobste.rs/t/meta) post for feature requests (including new tags) to let the community discuss.
