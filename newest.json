This question was raised many times when I had to analyze logs with modern solutions for logs. I couldn't find the proper solution, so decided creating it on my own based on my experience with creating VictoriaMetrics. So I created open-source user-friendly database for logs - [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/). It accepts structured and unstructured logs from popular log shippers such as Filebeat, Fluentbit, Logstash, Vector, etc., it supports fast full-text search without any configuration / tuning, and it has perfect integration with good old command-line tools. Read more about the integration [here](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/VictoriaLogs/querying/#command-line). Give it a try and share your experience!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7lmn0y/usability_modern_solutions_for_logs","submitter_user":{"username":"valyala","created_at":"2020-01-26T16:58:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"CTO at VictoriaMetrics, creator of VictoriaLogs","is_moderator":false,"karma":18,"avatar_url":"/avatars/valyala-100.png","invited_by_user":"bilinguliar","github_username":"valyala"},"tags":["devops"]},{"short_id":"yrn2et","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yrn2et","created_at":"2023-07-10T13:50:52.000-05:00","title":"Assembly as a first programming language?","url":"","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":29,"description":"\u003cp\u003eI came across this book[1] and was intrigued by the premise.
