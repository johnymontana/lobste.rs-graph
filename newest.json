We describe how we solve key integration challenges to make such techniques work and be effective on a real-system prototype, including memory allocation, alignment, and coherence. We observe that end-to-end RowClone speeds up bulk copy and initialization operations by 14.6× and 12.6×, respectively, over conventional CPU copy, even when coherence is supported with inefficient cache flush operations. Over PiDRAM’s extensible codebase, integrating both RowClone and D-RaNGe end-to-end on a real RISC-V system prototype takes only 388 lines of Verilog code and 643 lines of C++ code.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hqia7g/pidram_holistic_end_end_fpga_based","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95151,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","pdf"]},{"short_id":"2e4imj","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2e4imj","created_at":"2023-01-20T14:15:46.000-06:00","title":"A Practical Template Attack on CRYSTALS-Dilithium","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/050.pdf","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eThis paper presents a new profiling side-channel attack on the signature scheme CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which has been selected by the NIST as the new primary standard for quantum-safe digital signatures.

They allow detecting voltage fluctuations in the order of a few nanoseconds. The key building component of a TDC is a delay line, typically implemented as a chain of fast carry propagation multiplexers. In FPGAs, the fast carry chains are constrained to dedicated logic and routing, and need to be routed strictly vertically. In this work, we present an alternative approach to designing on-chip voltage sensors, in which the FPGA routing resources replace the carry logic.

We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on both the Sakura-X side-channel evaluation board and the Alveo U200 datacenter card, to evaluate the performance of the RDS sensors in the context of a remote power side-channel analysis attack.

On average, for breaking the full 128-bit key of an AES-128 cryptographic core, an adversary requires 35% fewer side-channel traces when using the RDS than when using the TDC.
