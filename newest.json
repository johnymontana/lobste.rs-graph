In particular, the analysis shows that, with high probability, the security guarantees of SPHINCS+ significantly drop when a single random bit flip occurs anywhere in the signing procedure and that the resulting faulty signature cannot be detected with the verification procedure. The paper shows both in theory and experimentally that the countermeasures based on caching the intermediate W-OTS+s offer a marginally greater protection against unintentional faults, and that such countermeasures are circumvented with a tolerable number of queries in an active attack. Based on these results, the paper recommends real-world deployments of SPHINCS+ to implement redundancy checks.\r\n\r\n[Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/042)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/5szhkh/on_protecting_sphincs_against_fault","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95146,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["cryptography","pdf"]},{"short_id":"jq0j3s","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jq0j3s","created_at":"2023-01-20T14:13:55.000-06:00","title":"A Closer Look at the Chaotic Ring Oscillators based TRNG Design","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/040.pdf","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eTRNG is an essential component for security applications.
