For example, if the bad commit was ID\r\n`abc123` according to the Git log, you could run\r\n`git log --format=%H --reverse abc123.. \u003e commits.txt` in the upstream repo to\r\nget a file with the relevant commit IDs.\r\n\r\nThen you need to figure out a test command, like\r\n`nix-build --attr foo tests/default.nix`, `npm test`,\r\n`pytest test_foo.py::test_name`, or something else entirely. If this command is\r\nfast, all the better, since it'll run up to log_2(N)+2 times to check through\r\n$N$ commits.\r\n\r\nAt this point you can run `/path/to/bisect.bash COMMAND /path/to/commits.txt` to\r\nfind the first offending commit.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example of this, I wrote `bisect.bash` to bump nixpkgs in\r\npoetry2nix, since `HEAD` of nixpkgs `master` was breaking the `nixops` package\r\nbuild.
