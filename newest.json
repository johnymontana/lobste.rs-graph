These algorithms are all presented within a common framework that allows them to be driven by the information collected by Rapid Type Analysis, or by some other type analysis algorithm.\u003cbr\u003e\nCollectively, the optimizations in this dissertation free the programmer from having to sacrifice modularity and extensibility for performance.
