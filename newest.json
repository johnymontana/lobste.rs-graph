We show that there exists a constant α=1.942±3×10−3 such that (n)=((1±o(1))ne−α)n. The constant α is characterized as the solution to a convex optimization problem in ([−1/2,1/2]2), the space of Borel probability measures on the square.\nThe chief innovation is the introduction of limit objects for n-queens configurations, which we call “queenons”. These are a convex set in ([−1/2,1/2]2). We define an entropy function that counts the number of n-queens configurations that approximate a given queenon. The upper bound uses the entropy method. For the lower bound we describe a randomized algorithm that constructs a configuration near a prespecified queenon and whose entropy matches that found in the upper bound. The enumeration of n-queens configurations is then obtained by maximizing the (concave) entropy function in the space of queenons.\nAlong the way we prove a large deviations principle for n-queens configurations that can be used to study their typical structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lchwod/number_n_queens_configurations","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2283,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["math"]},{"short_id":"3xet9i","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3xet9i","created_at":"2021-09-21T17:14:34.000-05:00","title":"Nyxt Release 2.2.0","url":"https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/release-2.2.0.org","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/3xet9i/nyxt_release_2_2_0","submitter_user":{"username":"jmercouris","created_at":"2019-08-19T04:03:42.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":260,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jmercouris-100.png","invited_by_user":"vindarel"},"tags":["browsers","emacs"]},{"short_id":"2t1kgn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2t1kgn","created_at":"2021-09-21T17:09:37.000-05:00","title":"Enumerating and analyzing 40+ non-V8 JavaScript implementations","url":"https://notes.eatonphil.com/javascript-implementations.html","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":6,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/2t1kgn/enumerating_analyzing_40_non_v8","submitter_user":{"username":"eatonphil","created_at":"2019-09-01T20:23:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Looking for what's next!
