It's been my first \"real\" project in this language which has been a great learning experience.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to write some posts on how `rbperf` works, why it's been designed this way, and the many learnings along the way thus far :)\r\n\r\nWould love to hear any feedback or ideas. I am still quite new to Rust, and I am sure that things can be improved a lot!
