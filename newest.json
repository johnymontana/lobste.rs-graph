Please don't be shy.\r\n\r\nntfy is a tool that lets you send push notifications to your phone from any script or server using a simple HTTP PUT/POST requests. It's [100% open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) and self-hostable, and has clients for Android/iOS/web/macOS/Windows/Linux. You can use it like this to send yourself notifications (more in the [docs](https://ntfy.sh/docs), and then receive them on your phone or desktop:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -d \"Backup on $(hostname) complete\" ntfy.sh/mytopic\r\n```\r\nIt integrates into [everything under the sun](https://docs.ntfy.sh/integrations/) and is super easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe ntfy.sh server is free to use for everyone within documented limits (which are enough for 90+% of users). If you need higher rate limits (more daily messages, bigger attachments, ...), you can **pay for plans in the [web app](https://ntfy.sh/app)**.\r\n\r\nI am happy to answer questions, and I'd love feedback to the tool, or to the new website.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/5drapz/ntfy_sh_open_source_push_notifications","submitter_user":{"username":"binwiederhier","created_at":"2022-08-09T20:36:36.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Principal Engineer, open source fan, semi-regular blogger, German, fan of UK \u0026 US, and a dad.\r\n\r\nhttps://heckel.io / https://github.com/binwiederhier","is_moderator":false,"karma":47,"avatar_url":"/avatars/binwiederhier-100.png","invited_by_user":"goalieca"},"tags":["go","programming","release"]}]
