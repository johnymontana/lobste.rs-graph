This paper introduces a generic non-invasive and low-cost counterfeit chip detection based on characterizing the impedance of the system’s power delivery network (PDN). Our method relies on the fact that the impedance of the counterfeit and recycled chips differs from the genuine ones. To sense such impedance variations confidently, we deploy scattering parameters, frequently used for impedance characterization of RF/microwave circuits.
