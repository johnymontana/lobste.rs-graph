And that is the part that is not as widely advertised as the fact that he was opposed. Hilbert became such a giant in the field that if Hilbert said something, it was true, that’s it. Who’s going to oppose Hilbert? Brouwer had the chutzpah to oppose Hilbert. […] Hilbert was actually wrong about some of the things he said. That has given rise to this feeling that there is something deviant or contrary or incompatible between the constructive view and the traditional view, that I have hinted at when explaining Brouwer’s program. I am going to attempt to show you through several levels of deepening that that is not the case. In fact, in a certain sense, the type theory that we’ll develop is completely compatible with classical patterns of reasoning. There is no opposition there at all. But, it is very important for the purposes of everything I’ve said so far, that the theory be constructive. And the reason is, […] the Axiomatic Freedom of Constructive Mathematics. […] The way to think about it is this: Fewer assumptions lead to stronger results” Around 43:40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“if you think through what is a proof, from the perspective of a construction […] you question the universal validity of the law of the excluded middle […] and then, you are constructivist. A lot of people say that your friends won’t talk to you any more. Nothing you can do about this.”. Around 51:00\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“type theory is the grand unified theory of computation. It is what programming languages \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e. There is nothing else. We’re just studying type theory. Eventually all the arbitrary programming languages are going to be swept away with the oceans. We will have the permanence of constructive intuitionistic type theory as the master theory of computation, without doubt in my mind. […] Working in anything else is a waste of time”.

And that is the part that is not as widely advertised as the fact that he was opposed. Hilbert became such a giant in the field that if Hilbert said something, it was true, that's it. Who's going to oppose Hilbert? Brouwer had the chutzpah to oppose Hilbert. [...] Hilbert was actually wrong about some of the things he said. That has given rise to this feeling that there is something deviant or contrary or incompatible between the constructive view and the traditional view, that I have hinted at when explaining Brouwer's program. I am going to attempt to show you through several levels of deepening that that is not the case. In fact, in a certain sense, the type theory that we'll develop is completely compatible with classical patterns of reasoning. There is no opposition there at all. But, it is very important for the purposes of everything I've said so far, that the theory be constructive. And the reason is, [...] the Axiomatic Freedom of Constructive Mathematics. [...] The way to think about it is this: Fewer assumptions lead to stronger results\" Around 43:40\r\n\r\n* \"if you think through what is a proof, from the perspective of a construction [...] you question the universal validity of the law of the excluded middle [...] and then, you are constructivist. A lot of people say that your friends won't talk to you any more. Nothing you can do about this.\". Around 51:00\r\n\r\n* \"type theory is the grand unified theory of computation. It is what programming languages *is*. There is nothing else. We're just studying type theory. Eventually all the arbitrary programming languages are going to be swept away with the oceans.
