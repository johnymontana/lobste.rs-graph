This allows highly parallel algorithms to maintain performance over several processing steps and reduces overall memory usage.\nFor wide SIMD many-core architectures, we present a novel stream compaction algorithm and explore several variations thereof. Our algorithm is designed to maximize concurrent execution, with minimal  use of synchronization. Bandwidth and auxiliary storage requirements are reduced significantly, which allows for substantially better performance.\nWe have tested our algorithms using CUDA on a PC with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX280 GPU. On this hardware, our reference implementation provides a 3× speedup over previous published algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xifiwx/efficient_stream_compaction_on_wide_simd","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2023,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["compsci","pdf"]},{"short_id":"tu9h5x","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tu9h5x","created_at":"2021-08-12T19:54:33.000-05:00","title":"Creating a Space Game with OpenAI Codex","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm9B-DvwOgw","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tu9h5x/creating_space_game_with_openai_codex","submitter_user":{"username":"sanxiyn","created_at":"2015-01-21T09:51:34.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I made the initial port of Rust to ARM and Android.","is_moderator":false,"karma":8330,"avatar_url":"/avatars/sanxiyn-100.png","invited_by_user":"steveklabnik","github_username":"sanxiyn","twitter_username":"sanxiyn"},"tags":["ai","video"]},{"short_id":"ow0vih","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ow0vih","created_at":"2021-08-12T16:53:16.000-05:00","title":"Preview Features in .NET 6 - Generic Math","url":"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ow0vih/preview_features_net_6_generic_math","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.","is_moderator":false,"karma":81671,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["dotnet"]},{"short_id":"alfbeg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/alfbeg","created_at":"2021-08-12T16:25:30.000-05:00","title":"Rust GUI Infrastructure","url":"http://www.cmyr.net/blog/rust-gui-infra.html","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/alfbeg/rust_gui_infrastructure","submitter_user":{"username":"technetium","created_at":"2020-02-06T19:52:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"A sentient lump of a certain high-density material","is_moderator":false,"karma":2507,"avatar_url":"/avatars/technetium-100.png","invited_by_user":"ngoldbaum"},"tags":["a11y","design","graphics","rust"]},{"short_id":"pw4onb","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pw4onb","created_at":"2021-08-12T16:02:23.000-05:00","title":"Should the browser use all available memory?","url":"https://jmmv.dev/2021/08/using-all-memory-as-a-cache.html","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/pw4onb/should_browser_use_all_available_memory","submitter_user":{"username":"wezm","created_at":"2017-03-13T19:52:34.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Programmer originally from Melbourne, Australia, now living in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.

elucidates the essence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), using a constructive approach: we identify a minimal basis of concepts with which to synthesize existing and potential object systems. We reduce them to constructions atop the pure untyped lambda calculus, thereby obtaining both denotational semantics and effective implementation. We start from the simplest recognizable model of prototype-based OOP, so simple it arguably does not even have “objects” as such. We build further models of increasing sophistication, reproducing a growing subset of features found in past object systems, including original combinations. We also examine how our approach can deal with issues like typing, modularity, classes, mutation. We use Scheme to illustrate our approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gzsh15/prototypes_object_orientation","submitter_user":{"username":"mjn","created_at":"2015-02-11T16:45:32.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm an academic in artificial intelligence.
