It has the desirable characteristics of low memory overhead and short pause times, which are key in today’s interactive mobile platforms. However, RC has a higher execution time overhead than its counterpart, tracing garbage collection. The reason is that RC implementations maintain per-object counters, which must be continually updated. In particular, the execution time overhead is high in environments where low memory overhead is critical and, therefore, non-deferred RC is used. This is because the counter updates need to be performed atomically.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo address this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called Biased Reference Counting (BRC), which significantly improves the performance of non-deferred RC. BRC is based on the observation that most objects are only accessed by a single thread, which allows most RC operations to be performed non-atomically. BRC leverages this by biasing each object towards a specific thread, and keeping two counters for each object — one updated by the owner thread and another updated by the other threads. This allows the owner thread to perform RC operations non-atomically, while the other threads update the second counter atomically.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe implement BRC in the Swift programming language run- time, and evaluate it with client and server programs. We find that BRC makes each RC operation more than twice faster in the common case. As a result, BRC reduces the average execution time of client programs by 22.5%, and boosts the average throughput of server programs by 7.3%.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gwvje6/biased_reference_counting_minimizing","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2280,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["pdf","programming"]},{"short_id":"po8sfa","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/po8sfa","created_at":"2021-09-21T08:21:12.000-05:00","title":"DataStation, open source data IDE, 0.1.0 is released","url":"https://datastation.multiprocess.io/docs/0.1.0-release-notes.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/po8sfa/datastation_open_source_data_ide_0_1_0_is","submitter_user":{"username":"eatonphil","created_at":"2019-09-01T20:23:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Looking for what's next!
