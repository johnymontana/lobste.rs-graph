To encourage good security practice, Lobsters should check for a working https connection before allowing a link submission to succeed. For example,\r\n\r\n- If the link is http, not https,\r\n- Or if it is https but a connection attempt to the endpoint fails with a TLS error (e.g. cert expired or secure algorithms not supported),\r\n\r\nIn these cases Lobsters should reject the submission.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zbuc2b/check_for_working_https_before_allowing","submitter_user":{"username":"yawaramin","created_at":"2017-01-22T00:02:18.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1248,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yawaramin-100.png","invited_by_user":"awal"},"tags":["meta"]},{"short_id":"7lpwis","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7lpwis","created_at":"2023-02-04T16:21:40.000-06:00","title":"Lisa Source Code: Understanding Clascal","url":"http://eschatologist.net/blog/?p=314","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7lpwis/lisa_source_code_understanding_clascal","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95309,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["historical","programming"]},{"short_id":"hqul8b","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hqul8b","created_at":"2023-02-04T16:16:34.000-06:00","title":"The Magic of Sampling, and its Limitations","url":"https://research.swtch.com/sample","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hqul8b/magic_sampling_its_limitations","submitter_user":{"username":"carlmjohnson","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carl M.
