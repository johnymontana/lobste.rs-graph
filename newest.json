No GUI\r\n1. No goal of selling it\r\n1. Keeping it FOSS\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to distribute it in 2023?\r\n\r\n1. With the ease of auto-updates\r\n1.  Distribute it as a compiled binary that can be installed with a single command\r\n\r\nI am relatively agnostic to the language I would write in.\r\n\r\nThe options that I have looked at\r\n\r\n1. `brew` is Mac only. \r\n1. `apt` is Debian only. \r\n1. `docker` requires `Docker` desktop to be running. \r\n1. `pip` leads to [Python dependency hell](https://xkcd.com/1987/)\r\n1. `go install` and `cargo install` requires Go and cargo to be installed, respectively\r\n1. Distributing binaries does not lead to auto-update","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wk9qye/best_way_distribute_foss_tool_2023","submitter_user":{"username":"ashishb","created_at":"2020-01-27T14:22:18.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"[https://ashishb.net/about](https://ashishb.net/about)","is_moderator":false,"karma":246,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ashishb-100.png","invited_by_user":"lukaszkorecki"},"tags":["ask","programming"]},{"short_id":"jyxbvs","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jyxbvs","created_at":"2023-03-27T01:26:02.000-05:00","title":"bread: BIOS Reverse Engineering \u0026 Advanced Debugging","url":"https://github.com/Theldus/bread","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jyxbvs/bread_bios_reverse_engineering_advanced","submitter_user":{"username":"jeanthomas","created_at":"2021-12-14T12:53:17.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":279,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jeanthomas-100.png","invited_by_user":"brainstorm","github_username":"jeanthom"},"tags":["assembly","debugging","osdev","reversing"]},{"short_id":"kuze4g","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kuze4g","created_at":"2023-03-27T00:54:19.000-05:00","title":"Using std::shared_ptr for reloadable config","url":"https://ddanilov.me/usage-of-shared_ptr","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kuze4g/using_std_shared_ptr_for_reloadable","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":20068,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]},{"short_id":"tdfr5h","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tdfr5h","created_at":"2023-03-27T00:39:13.000-05:00","title":"The craziest thing I ever used SQLite for: partial file deduplication","url":"https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/7fecf11e42c71a91?raw","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tdfr5h/craziest_thing_i_ever_used_sqlite_for","submitter_user":{"username":"nalzok","created_at":"2019-06-20T08:59:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1342,"avatar_url":"/avatars/nalzok-100.png","invited_by_user":"WilhelmVonWeiner","github_username":"nalzok","twitter_username":"fixed_bug","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"nalzok","sig_hash":"dfe65412a3e7fa28e06a07a9dc2c824b14032f40c58b3c4bac3f00bd837570bb0f"}]},"tags":["databases"]},{"short_id":"ojaz0l","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ojaz0l","created_at":"2023-03-26T19:01:39.000-05:00","title":"Telemetry Is Not Your Enemy","url":"https://blog.glyph.im/2023/03/telemetry-is-not-your-enemy.html","score":21,"flags":2,"comment_count":33,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ojaz0l/telemetry_is_not_your_enemy","submitter_user":{"username":"carlmjohnson","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carl M.
