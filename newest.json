This is normally dismissed as being unacceptably expensive, but the underlying cost analyses consider only software written for current instruction-set architectures, so they do not rule out the possibility of a new instruction-set architecture providing acceptable performance without speculative execution. A new ISA requires compiler and hardware updates, but these are happening in any case.\r\nThis paper introduces BasicBlocker, a generic ISA modification that works for all common ISAs and that allows non-speculative CPUs to obtain most of the performance benefit that would have been provided by speculative execution. To demonstrate the feasibility of BasicBlocker, this paper defines a variant of the RISC-V ISA called BBRISC-V and provides a thorough evaluation on both a 5-stage in-order soft core and a superscalar out-of-order processor using an associated compiler and a variety of benchmark programs.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xozsas/basicblocker_isa_redesign_make_spectre","submitter_user":{"username":"dzwdz","created_at":"2022-08-07T08:15:00.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":388,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dzwdz-100.png","invited_by_user":"login"},"tags":["assembly","hardware","security"]},{"short_id":"xbnyuw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xbnyuw","created_at":"2023-07-24T16:23:04.000-05:00","title":"Introducing Intel® Advanced Performance Extensions (Intel® APX)","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/advanced-performance-extensions-apx.html","score":20,"flags":0,"comment_count":12,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xbnyuw/introducing_intel_advanced_performance","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":97896,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["assembly","release"]},{"short_id":"dx2etl","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dx2etl","created_at":"2023-07-24T15:57:09.000-05:00","title":"Better code highlighting on the web: rehype-tree-sitter","url":"https://haz.ee/technical/rehype-tree-sitter/","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dx2etl/better_code_highlighting_on_web_rehype","submitter_user":{"username":"haze","created_at":"2021-02-12T18:38:19.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"SWE","is_moderator":false,"karma":52,"avatar_url":"/avatars/haze-100.png","invited_by_user":"kristoff","github_username":"haze"},"tags":["web"]},{"short_id":"ckgesk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ckgesk","created_at":"2023-07-24T15:01:47.000-05:00","title":"From U2F to passkeys","url":"https://www.imperialviolet.org/2023/07/23/u2f-to-passkeys.html","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ckgesk/from_u2f_passkeys","submitter_user":{"username":"trousers","created_at":"2012-11-01T22:23:30.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"\u003e \"The problem with quotes on the internet is you never know if they are genuine.\" -- Benjamin Franklin\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":4750,"avatar_url":"/avatars/trousers-100.png","invited_by_user":"jcs"},"tags":["security"]},{"short_id":"te7x8n","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/te7x8n","created_at":"2023-07-24T14:28:45.000-05:00","title":"Durable Incrementality","url":"https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2023/07/24/durable-incrementality.html","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":15,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/te7x8n/durable_incrementality","submitter_user":{"username":"matklad","created_at":"2019-07-02T07:23:10.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":6795,"avatar_url":"/avatars/matklad-100.png","invited_by_user":"skade","github_username":"matklad"},"tags":["compilers"]},{"short_id":"l8sinu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/l8sinu","created_at":"2023-07-24T14:17:44.000-05:00","title":"A Breakdown of HTTP Clients in Elixir","url":"https://andrealeopardi.com/posts/breakdown-of-http-clients-in-elixir/","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/l8sinu/breakdown_http_clients_elixir","submitter_user":{"username":"friendlysock","created_at":"2014-02-20T00:43:41.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"*Literally* full of ants.\r\n\r\nFriendly engineer and human being.\r\n\r\nStrong opinions held weakly, sometimes weekly.\r\n\r\n\u003e Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified and alchemised into money. \r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":40367,"avatar_url":"/avatars/friendlysock-100.png","invited_by_user":"MasonJar"},"tags":["elixir"]}]
