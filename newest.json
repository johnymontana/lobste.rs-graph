Since such hacking has proven prohibitively\r\nhard due to compact hardware, its feasibility in keeping up with\r\nfast-developing Wi-Fi technology becomes very questionable. To\r\nthis end, we propose WiKI-Eve to eavesdrop keystrokes on smart-\r\nphones without the need for hacking. WiKI-Eve exploits a new\r\nfeature, BFI (beamforming feedback information), offered by latest\r\nWi-Fi hardware: since BFI is transmitted from a smartphone to\r\nan AP in clear-text, it can be overheard (hence eavesdropped) by\r\nany other Wi-Fi devices switching to monitor mode.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/n7cc9h/password_stealing_without_hacking_wi_fi","submitter_user":{"username":"posix_cowboy","created_at":"2018-06-08T14:22:44.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":80,"avatar_url":"/avatars/posix_cowboy-100.png","invited_by_user":"rocx"},"tags":["ai","pdf","security"]}]
