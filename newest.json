We show that there exists a constant α=1.942±3×10−3 such that (n)=((1±o(1))ne−α)n. The constant α is characterized as the solution to a convex optimization problem in ([−1/2,1/2]2), the space of Borel probability measures on the square.\nThe chief innovation is the introduction of limit objects for n-queens configurations, which we call “queenons”. These are a convex set in ([−1/2,1/2]2). We define an entropy function that counts the number of n-queens configurations that approximate a given queenon. The upper bound uses the entropy method. For the lower bound we describe a randomized algorithm that constructs a configuration near a prespecified queenon and whose entropy matches that found in the upper bound. The enumeration of n-queens configurations is then obtained by maximizing the (concave) entropy function in the space of queenons.\nAlong the way we prove a large deviations principle for n-queens configurations that can be used to study their typical structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lchwod/number_n_queens_configurations","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2288,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["math"]}]
