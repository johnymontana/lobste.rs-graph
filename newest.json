We propose to take UDFs for what they are (namely functions) and subject UDFs to a pipeline of function compilation techniques well-established by the FP community (CPS conversion, defunctionalization, and translation into trampolined style, in particular). The result is a non-invasive SQL-level compiler for recursive UDFs that naturally supports memoization and emits iterative CTEs which contemporary SQL engines evaluate efficiently.
