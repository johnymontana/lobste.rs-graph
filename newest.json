(previously: Cornwall, Copenhagen, Santa Cruz, Atlanta, ...).\r\n\r\nWebsite: [kmjn.org](http://www.kmjn.org/)","is_moderator":false,"karma":6561,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mjn-100.png","invited_by_user":"itistoday","twitter_username":"mm_jj_nn"},"tags":["release"]},{"short_id":"a7woyg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a7woyg","created_at":"2022-07-07T13:56:16.000-05:00","title":"pagy - The Best Pagination Ruby Gem","url":"https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a7woyg/pagy_best_pagination_ruby_gem","submitter_user":{"username":"gregnavis","created_at":"2014-07-10T09:00:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I help to scale Heroku-hosted Rails apps.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gregnavis.com/scaling-rails-on-heroku/\r\n\r\ncontact@gregnavis.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":606,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gregnavis-100.png","invited_by_user":"mempko"},"tags":["ruby"]},{"short_id":"rssbig","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rssbig","created_at":"2022-07-07T13:19:04.000-05:00","title":"A curated list of papers for Software Engineers","url":"https://github.com/facundoolano/software-papers/","score":41,"flags":1,"comment_count":11,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rssbig/curated_list_papers_for_software","submitter_user":{"username":"facundoolano","created_at":"2016-03-20T16:03:23.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":203,"avatar_url":"/avatars/facundoolano-100.png","invited_by_user":"unbalancedparentheses"},"tags":["compsci","programming","science"]},{"short_id":"xo2zaq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xo2zaq","created_at":"2022-07-07T12:47:20.000-05:00","title":"I built a keyboard PCB and wrote firmware for it in Rust","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/vtlujd/i_built_a_keyboard_pcb_and_wrote_firmware_for_it/","score":23,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xo2zaq/i_built_keyboard_pcb_wrote_firmware_for_it","submitter_user":{"username":"briankung","created_at":"2017-04-03T00:20:29.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1735,"avatar_url":"/avatars/briankung-100.png","invited_by_user":"gsylvie"},"tags":["hardware","rust"]},{"short_id":"mifvpa","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mifvpa","created_at":"2022-07-07T12:28:00.000-05:00","title":"Painlessly developing Python on NixOS with pipenv (2018)","url":"https://sid-kap.github.io/posts/2018-03-08-nix-pipenv.html","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mifvpa/painlessly_developing_python_on_nixos","submitter_user":{"username":"rjpcasalino","created_at":"2017-01-06T17:15:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"If problems occur, consult the internet.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1133,"avatar_url":"/avatars/rjpcasalino-100.png","invited_by_user":"bsima"},"tags":["nix","python"]},{"short_id":"xnhxzc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xnhxzc","created_at":"2022-07-07T09:57:54.000-05:00","title":"Analyzing and Mitigating XML External Entity Vulnerabilities in Apache NiFi","url":"https://exceptionfactory.com/posts/2022/05/31/analyzing-and-mitigating-xml-external-entity-vulnerabilities-in-apache-nifi/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xnhxzc/analyzing_mitigating_xml_external","submitter_user":{"username":"thesnarky1","created_at":"2020-06-09T14:41:58.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":310,"avatar_url":"/avatars/thesnarky1-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["java","security"]}]
