The goal of ILP is to induce a hypothesis (a set of logical rules) that generalises given training examples. In contrast to most forms of machine learning, ILP can learn human-readable hypotheses from small amounts of data. As ILP approaches 30, we provide a new introduction to the field. We introduce the necessary logical notation and the main ILP learning settings. We describe the main building blocks of an ILP system. We compare several ILP systems on several dimensions. We describe in detail four systems (Aleph, TILDE, ASPAL, and Metagol). We document some of the main application areas of ILP.
