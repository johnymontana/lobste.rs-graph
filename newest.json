Also makes it annoying to `^C` the whole thing. \r\n* just inherit stderr -- simple, but it's hard to say which output comes from which node\r\n* pipe stderrs and append node ids to each line/record, or layout output as n columns -- my current favorite, but needs a fair amount of programming and I am unsure about details\r\n* buffer stderr and print continous chunks at the end of the test -- I want live output\r\n\r\nIs there perhaps some secret ANSI ~cheat~ escape code to unlock bonus file descriptors for stderr2 and such? Or perhaps there's some existing library which implements something like mini-tmux? Really, interested in any prior art here, as I feel like I've seen this problem several times, but I can't recall any nifty real-world solutions.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/cekies/approaches_for_interleaving_several","submitter_user":{"username":"matklad","created_at":"2019-07-02T07:23:10.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Working on IDE support for the Rust language.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/matklad","is_moderator":false,"karma":3294,"avatar_url":"/avatars/matklad-100.png","invited_by_user":"skade","github_username":"matklad"},"tags":["ask","debugging"]},{"short_id":"vjkcnh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vjkcnh","created_at":"2022-08-07T12:51:30.000-05:00","title":"Shaving 40% off Google's B-Tree Implementation with Go Generics","url":"https://thenewstack.io/shaving-40-off-googles-b-tree-implementation-with-go-generics/","score":5,"flags":1,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vjkcnh/shaving_40_off_google_s_b_tree","submitter_user":{"username":"sanxiyn","created_at":"2015-01-21T09:51:34.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I made the initial port of Rust to ARM and Android.","is_moderator":false,"karma":9874,"avatar_url":"/avatars/sanxiyn-100.png","invited_by_user":"steveklabnik","github_username":"sanxiyn","twitter_username":"sanxiyn"},"tags":["go","performance"]},{"short_id":"lvcskk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lvcskk","created_at":"2022-08-07T11:32:44.000-05:00","title":"wisp: Whitespace to Lisp [alternate Lisp syntax]","url":"https://www.draketo.de/software/wisp","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/lvcskk/wisp_whitespace_lisp_alternate_lisp","submitter_user":{"username":"snej","created_at":"2020-01-26T19:05:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mobile Architect at Couchbase.
