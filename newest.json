I’ve heard some of the FAANG/GAFAM apologists spreading the sentiment that RHEL deserves to be compensated for the work they contribute — and they have been and will continue to be, but, this has nothing to do with the fact that they are strategically and systematically destroying, quite deliberately, the communities that created them, which while these projects are newer consist mostly of the people that built all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution is easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst, someone needs to create a repository and a platform dedicated for this purpose, like “rheldist.org” or similar.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePeople who will make anonymous contributions (anonymous to the public and not to internal teams) to that platform would relay this GPL-licensed material accessed from their RHEL subscriptions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA validation team also with subscriptions would vet the material as it comes in.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe group hosting it ensures there is an active supply of new subscriptions being created for the sole purpose of violating those subscription agreements, and people to use those subscriptions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no legal recourse for this by RedHat beyond occassionally terminating subscriptions for people they think are involved in relaying the content.  What I mean by this is that while it may violate a subscription agreement, it does not violate the law, unless RH is asserting that their subscription agreement modifies the GPL, which would violate the GPL they depend on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason this is not actionable by RedHat is because while they can restrict \u003cem\u003ewho\u003c/em\u003e they provide the licensed material to they do not actually \u003cem\u003eown\u003c/em\u003e any license at all on that material they’re providing.

Two notable examples are AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux. Since IBM’s RedHat had claimed the CentOS change was about optimizing the development lifecycle for RHEL, this should seem to be irrelevant to them.\r\n\r\nExcept, it wasn’t about that at all once those projects got large. Four years later, almost to the day, IBM’s RedHat has announced that:\r\n\r\n- it will no longer be making publicly accessible the source code for RHEL\r\n- that source code will be distributed only to paying customers in a walled garden model\r\n- the subscription agreement will forbid subscribers from building a RHEL clone or publishing the GPL-- licensed software they were being given access to.\r\n\r\nWhich has these impacts on those RHEL bug-for-bug clones:\r\n\r\n- they can no longer get access to the source code for RHEL to build the bug-for-bug clone\r\nthis includes security patches\r\n- developers who write security patches in these communities, should they choose to submit their patches upstream, will no longer be able to access their own patches for inclusion in their own distribution without violating the RHEL subscription terms\r\n\r\nThey seem to operate on a four year cycle and I have identified a way around this barrier they’ve put around all these downstream communities. I’ve heard some of the FAANG/GAFAM apologists spreading the sentiment that RHEL deserves to be compensated for the work they contribute — and they have been and will continue to be, but, this has nothing to do with the fact that they are strategically and systematically destroying, quite deliberately, the communities that created them, which while these projects are newer consist mostly of the people that built all of this.\r\n\r\nThe solution is easy.\r\n\r\n- First, someone needs to create a repository and a platform dedicated for this purpose, like “rheldist.org” or similar.\r\n- People who will make anonymous contributions (anonymous to the public and not to internal teams) to that platform would relay this GPL-licensed material accessed from their RHEL subscriptions.\r\n- A validation team also with subscriptions would vet the material as it comes in.\r\n- The group hosting it ensures there is an active supply of new subscriptions being created for the sole purpose of violating those subscription agreements, and people to use those subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThere is no legal recourse for this by RedHat beyond occassionally terminating subscriptions for people they think are involved in relaying the content.  What I mean by this is that while it may violate a subscription agreement, it does not violate the law, unless RH is asserting that their subscription agreement modifies the GPL, which would violate the GPL they depend on.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is not actionable by RedHat is because while they can restrict *who* they provide the licensed material to they do not actually *own* any license at all on that material they’re providing. So, unless they drop the GPL license with a full rewrite of their entire software ecosystem, they cannot sue someone for re-releasing material that they have released as part of their own obligation to fulfill the GPL license. I encourage anyone reading this to run this by an intellectual property attorney.\r\n\r\nI am actively soliciting feedback on the viability of a solution like this as so far I am not able to see any way this would be preventable.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/czuvct/request_for_feedback_solution_rhel_s","submitter_user":{"username":"bagira","created_at":"2023-06-23T10:53:58.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I pop in and out of existence as necessary.","is_moderator":false,"karma":9,"avatar_url":"/avatars/bagira-100.png","invited_by_user":"jjasghar","github_username":"cmpunches"},"tags":["law","linux"]},{"short_id":"ugzrkz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ugzrkz","created_at":"2023-07-15T21:18:50.000-05:00","title":"The Perfect Laptop","url":"https://blog.brossia.com/posts/the_perfect_laptop/","score":18,"flags":0,"comment_count":25,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ugzrkz/perfect_laptop","submitter_user":{"username":"aae","created_at":"2020-06-05T07:21:16.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":328,"avatar_url":"/avatars/aae-100.png","invited_by_user":"pja"},"tags":["hardware"]},{"short_id":"j65fea","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/j65fea","created_at":"2023-07-15T18:48:13.000-05:00","title":"Ada Outperforms Assembly: A Case Study","url":"https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~adagroup/sigada-website/lawlis.html","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":5,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/j65fea/ada_outperforms_assembly_case_study","submitter_user":{"username":"idrougge","created_at":"2020-03-20T09:40:53.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2144,"avatar_url":"/avatars/idrougge-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson"},"tags":["assembly"]},{"short_id":"cr4yuc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/cr4yuc","created_at":"2023-07-15T18:46:47.000-05:00","title":"a5k: Another World on a chip","url":"https://github.com/sylefeb/a5k","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/cr4yuc/a5k_another_world_on_chip","submitter_user":{"username":"wezm","created_at":"2017-03-13T19:52:34.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Programmer originally from Melbourne, Australia, now living in the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.
