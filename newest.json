Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings. \r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/abjy9x/aperiodic_monotile","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96191,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["math","pdf"]},{"short_id":"etebxo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/etebxo","created_at":"2023-03-20T22:38:48.000-05:00","title":"Current problems in the alerting space","url":"https://medium.com/keepalerting/current-problems-in-the-alerting-space-8805f8a2419d","score":-2,"flags":3,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/etebxo/current_problems_alerting_space","submitter_user":{"username":"shahargl","created_at":"2023-03-19T22:00:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"CTO of Keep keephq.dev","is_moderator":false,"karma":-3,"avatar_url":"/avatars/shahargl-100.png","invited_by_user":"colman"},"tags":["devops"]},{"short_id":"ozsdjz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ozsdjz","created_at":"2023-03-20T19:08:45.000-05:00","title":"Launch OpenBSD vmd Guests on Demand from SSH","url":"https://jonwillia.ms/2023/03/20/vmctl-ssh","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ozsdjz/launch_openbsd_vmd_guests_on_demand_from","submitter_user":{"username":"wizardishungry","created_at":"2018-08-13T10:39:55.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1123,"avatar_url":"/avatars/wizardishungry-100.png","invited_by_user":"kusuriya","github_username":"WIZARDISHUNGRY","twitter_username":"WIZARDISHUNGRY","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"wizardishungry","sig_hash":"c5e8c0f01d3e047b18f748ada5a8201b2cce3bf5bb2477ec7d404b1c99a5d94b0f"}]},"tags":["openbsd","virtualization"]},{"short_id":"dgnbim","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dgnbim","created_at":"2023-03-20T16:06:19.000-05:00","title":"Notes on FFTs: for users","url":"https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2023/03/19/notes-on-ffts-for-users/","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dgnbim/notes_on_ffts_for_users","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96191,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"ll7j3i","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ll7j3i","created_at":"2023-03-20T14:07:19.000-05:00","title":"Update on ARC's recent eval efforts","url":"https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ll7j3i/update_on_arc_s_recent_eval_efforts","submitter_user":{"username":"river","created_at":"2016-04-03T11:33:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"(Deleted account)","is_moderator":false,"karma":5357,"avatar_url":"/avatars/river-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B"},"tags":["ai"]}]
