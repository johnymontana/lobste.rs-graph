What libraries and language features do you know that let you express that code is new, or old, or changing, and provide the right behaviour to go with it? Examples and discussion are equally welcome.\r\n\r\nSome examples to get you going:\r\n- Ruby's [Scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) gem lets you try out a new function side-by-side with using the old function, and record differences in timing and behaviour.\r\n- Simon Hørup Eskildsen's article on [Shitlist Driven Development](https://sirupsen.com/shitlists) gives a deprecated function a whitelist, so any new callers can be headed off at the pass.\r\n- Stephan Boyer's [https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical](Typical): implements a field type `asymmetric` that compiles to 'required' for producers, but 'optional' for consumers. This intermediate stage lets you safely transition a field between 'optional everywhere' to 'required everywhere', without the careful staged rollouts that manual asymmetry requires.\r\n- [this Twitter thread on process in code](https://nitter.net/evinism/status/1338684345603657730#m) between @evinism and @hwayne","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hy8xw1/what_code_constructs_express_team","submitter_user":{"username":"Sietsebb","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:32:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3098,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Sietsebb-100.png","invited_by_user":"asthasr"},"tags":["ask","plt","practices"]}]
