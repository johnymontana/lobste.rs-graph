It is similar to gflags, but more powerful:\r\n- Support parameters from both command-line and config file.\r\n- Support automatic generation of the config file.\r\n- Support flag aliases.\r\n- Flag of integer type, the value can take a unit `k,m,g,t,p`.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/flag.h\"\r\n#include \"co/cout.h\"\r\n\r\nDEF_bool(x, false, \"x\");\r\nDEF_bool(debug, false, \"dbg\", d);\r\nDEF_uint32(u, 0, \"xxx\");\r\nDEF_string(s, \"\", \"xx\");\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n    COUT \u003c\u003c \"x: \" \u003c\u003c FLG_x;\r\n    COUT \u003c\u003c \"y: \" \u003c\u003c FLG_y;\r\n    COUT \u003c\u003c \"debug: \" \u003c\u003c FLG_debug;\r\n    COUT \u003c\u003c \"u: \" \u003c\u003c FLG_u;\r\n    COUT \u003c\u003c FLG_s \u003c\u003c \"|\" \u003c\u003c FLG_s.size();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the macros start with `DEF_` define 4 flags. Each flag corresponds to a global variable, whose name is `FLG_` plus the flag name. The flag `debug` has an alias `d`. After building, the above code can run as follow:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./xx                  # Run with default configs\r\n./xx -x -s good       # x -\u003e true, s -\u003e \"good\"\r\n./xx -debug           # debug -\u003e true\r\n./xx -xd              # x -\u003e true, debug -\u003e true\r\n./xx -u 8k            # u -\u003e 8192\r\n\r\n./xx -mkconf          # Automatically generate a config file: xx.conf\r\n./xx xx.conf          # run with a config file\r\n./xx -conf xx.conf    # Same as above\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### log\r\n\r\n**[log](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/log/)** is a high-performance log library, some components in coost use it to print logs.\r\n\r\nlog supports two types of logs: one is level log, which is divided into 5 levels: debug, info, warning, error and fatal, **printing a fatal log will terminate the program**; the other is topic log, logs are grouped by topic, and logs of different topics are written to different files.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/log.h\"\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n\r\n    TLOG(\"xx\") \u003c\u003c \"s\" \u003c\u003c 23; // topic log\r\n    DLOG \u003c\u003c \"hello \" \u003c\u003c 23;  // debug\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c \"hello \" \u003c\u003c 23;   // info\r\n    WLOG \u003c\u003c \"hello \" \u003c\u003c 23;  // warning\r\n    ELOG \u003c\u003c \"hello \" \u003c\u003c 23;  // error\r\n    FLOG \u003c\u003c \"hello \" \u003c\u003c 23;  // fatal\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nco/log also provides a series of `CHECK` macros, which is an enhanced version of `assert`, and they will not be cleared in debug mode.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid* p = malloc(32);\r\nCHECK(p != NULL) \u003c\u003c \"malloc failed..\";\r\nCHECK_NE(p, NULL) \u003c\u003c \"malloc failed..\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### unitest\r\n\r\n[unitest](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/unitest/) is a simple and easy-to-use unit test framework. Many components in coost use it to write unit test code, which guarantees the stability of coost.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/unitest.h\"\r\n#include \"co/os.h\"\r\n\r\nnamespace test {\r\n    \r\nDEF_test(os) {\r\n    DEF_case(homedir) {\r\n        EXPECT_NE(os::homedir(), \"\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    DEF_case(cpunum) {\r\n        EXPECT_GT(os::cpunum(), 0);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n    \r\n} // namespace test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above is a simple example. The `DEF_test` macro defines a test unit, which is actually a function (a method in a class). The `DEF_case` macro defines test cases, and each test case is actually a code block. The main function is simple as below:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/unitest.h\"\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n    unitest::run_all_tests();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe directory [unitest](https://github.com/idealvin/coost/tree/master/unitest) contains the unit test code in coost. Users can run unitest with the following commands:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nxmake r unitest      # Run all test cases\r\nxmake r unitest -os  # Run test cases in the os unit\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### JSON\r\n\r\nIn coost v3.0, **[Json](https://github.com/idealvin/coost/blob/master/include/co/json.h)** provides **fluent APIs**, which is more convenient to use.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// {\"a\":23,\"b\":false,\"s\":\"123\",\"v\":[1,2,3],\"o\":{\"xx\":0}}\r\nJson x = {\r\n    { \"a\", 23 },\r\n    { \"b\", false },\r\n    { \"s\", \"123\" },\r\n    { \"v\", {1,2,3} },\r\n    { \"o\", {\r\n        {\"xx\", 0}\r\n    }},\r\n};\r\n\r\n// equal to x\r\nJson y = Json()\r\n    .add_member(\"a\", 23)\r\n    .add_member(\"b\", false)\r\n    .add_member(\"s\", \"123\")\r\n    .add_member(\"v\", Json().push_back(1).push_back(2).push_back(3))\r\n    .add_member(\"o\", Json().add_member(\"xx\", 0));\r\n\r\nx.get(\"a\").as_int();       // 23\r\nx.get(\"s\").as_string();    // \"123\"\r\nx.get(\"s\").as_int();       // 123, string -\u003e int\r\nx.get(\"v\", 0).as_int();    // 1\r\nx.get(\"v\", 2).as_int();    // 3\r\nx.get(\"o\", \"xx\").as_int(); // 0\r\n\r\nx[\"a\"] == 23;          // true\r\nx[\"s\"] == \"123\";       // true\r\nx.get(\"o\", \"xx\") != 0; // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Coroutine\r\n\r\ncoost has implemented a [go-style](https://github.com/golang/go) coroutine, which has the following features:\r\n\r\n- Support multi-thread scheduling, the default number of threads is the number of system CPU cores.\r\n- Shared stack, coroutines in the same thread share several stacks (the default size is 1MB), and the memory usage is low.\r\n- There is a flat relationship between coroutines, and new coroutines can be created from anywhere (including in coroutines).\r\n- Support coroutine synchronization events, coroutine locks, channels, and waitgroups.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/co.h\"\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n\r\n    co::WaitGroup wg;\r\n    wg.add(2);\r\n\r\n    go([wg](){\r\n        LOG \u003c\u003c \"hello world\";\r\n        wg.done();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    go([wg](){\r\n        LOG \u003c\u003c \"hello again\";\r\n        wg.done();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    wg.wait();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code, the coroutines created by `go()` will be evenly distributed to different scheduling threads. Users can also control the scheduling of coroutines by themselves:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// run f1 and f2 in the same scheduler\r\nauto s = co::next_scheduler();\r\ns-\u003ego(f1);\r\ns-\u003ego(f2);\r\n\r\n// run f in all schedulers\r\nfor (auto\u0026 s : co::schedulers()) {\r\n    s-\u003ego(f);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### network programming\r\n\r\ncoost provides a coroutine-based network programming framework, which can be roughly divided into 3 parts:\r\n\r\n- **[coroutineized socket API](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/coroutine/#coroutineized-socket-api)**, similar in form to the system socket API, users familiar with socket programming can easily write high-performance network programs in a synchronous manner.\r\n- [TCP](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/net/tcp/), [HTTP](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/net/http/), [RPC](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/net/rpc/) and other high-level network programming components, compatible with IPv6, also support SSL, it is more convenient to use than socket API.\r\n- **[System API hook](https://coostdocs.github.io/en/co/coroutine/#system-api-hook)**, with which, third-party network libraries can be used directly in coroutines.\r\n\r\n\r\n**RPC server**\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/co.h\"\r\n#include \"co/rpc.h\"\r\n#include \"co/time.h\"\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n\r\n    rpc::Server()\r\n        .add_service(new xx::HelloWorldImpl)\r\n        .start(\"127.0.0.1\", 7788, \"/xx\");\r\n\r\n    for (;;) sleep::sec(80000);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`rpc::Server` also supports HTTP protocol, you may use the POST method to call the RPC service:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:7788/xx --request POST --data '{\"api\":\"ping\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Static web server**\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"co/flag.h\"\r\n#include \"co/http.h\"\r\n\r\nDEF_string(d, \".\", \"root dir\"); // docroot for the web server\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n    flag::init(argc, argv);\r\n    so::easy(FLG_d.c_str()); // mum never have to worry again\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**HTTP server**\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid cb(const http::Req\u0026 req, http::Res\u0026 res) {\r\n    if (req.is_method_get()) {\r\n        if (req.url() == \"/hello\") {\r\n            res.set_status(200);\r\n            res.set_body(\"hello world\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            res.set_status(404);\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        res.set_status(405); // method not allowed\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// http\r\nhttp::Server().on_req(cb).start(\"0.0.0.0\", 80);\r\n\r\n// https\r\nhttp::Server().on_req(cb).start(\r\n    \"0.0.0.0\", 443, \"privkey.pem\", \"certificate.pem\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**HTTP client**\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid f() {\r\n    http::Client c(\"https://github.com\");\r\n\r\n    c.get(\"/\");\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c \"response code: \"\u003c\u003c c.status();\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c \"body size: \"\u003c\u003c c.body().size();\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c \"Content-Length: \"\u003c\u003c c.header(\"Content-Length\");\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c c.header();\r\n\r\n    c.post(\"/hello\", \"data xxx\");\r\n    LOG \u003c\u003c \"response code: \"\u003c\u003c c.status();\r\n}\r\n\r\ngo(f);\r\n```","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/i5wkp8/coost_fantastic_c_library","submitter_user":{"username":"idealvin","created_at":"2022-01-18T08:53:26.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I'm a C++ programmer.
