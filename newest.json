In the distant past there were also electronic organizers/databanks but these were very slow, had very little memory, zero way of import/export data (or some rudimentary, obscure one) and I actually remember typing on one which slowed down when I was trying to write few paragraphs into a single note. However, such thing with 2023 technology would rock - that's not a market advice, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my quest is still not yet solved, but I carried myself away a bit here - **I would like to hear about your experiences**, how do you approach the note taking / brain dumping or is that even a problem for you? I don't expect solving my specific case, but maybe I could learn a thing or two from people in comments.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xaj9bz/what_s_your_braindump_second_brain","submitter_user":{"username":"skrzyp","created_at":"2016-05-21T16:41:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"````\r\n````","is_moderator":false,"karma":1549,"avatar_url":"/avatars/skrzyp-100.png","invited_by_user":"mulander"},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"qkpfes","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qkpfes","created_at":"2023-08-24T18:27:46.000-05:00","title":"Announcing Rust 1.72.0","url":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qkpfes/announcing_rust_1_72_0","submitter_user":{"username":"sanxiyn","created_at":"2015-01-21T09:51:34.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I made the initial port of Rust to ARM and Android.","is_moderator":false,"karma":11434,"avatar_url":"/avatars/sanxiyn-100.png","invited_by_user":"steveklabnik","github_username":"sanxiyn","twitter_username":"sanxiyn"},"tags":["release","rust"]},{"short_id":"sbjrkg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sbjrkg","created_at":"2023-08-24T18:02:04.000-05:00","title":"Making FreeBSD QUIC","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEKyBr1LS3s","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sbjrkg/making_freebsd_quic","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":3079,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["freebsd","performance","video"]},{"short_id":"sjsueq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sjsueq","created_at":"2023-08-24T17:28:15.000-05:00","title":"\"A philosophy of software design\" summarized","url":"https://www.mattduck.com/2021-04-a-philosophy-of-software-design.html","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sjsueq/philosophy_software_design_summarized","submitter_user":{"username":"Verdagon","created_at":"2020-07-31T04:47:19.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":331,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Verdagon-100.png","invited_by_user":"slavfox"},"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"ph7rnw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ph7rnw","created_at":"2023-08-24T16:42:07.000-05:00","title":"Evaluating Algebraic Expressions using Parser Combinators","url":"https://blog.varunramesh.net/posts/algebraic-expressions-using-parser-combinators/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ph7rnw/evaluating_algebraic_expressions_using","submitter_user":{"username":"vramesh","created_at":"2014-07-09T13:15:42.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":50,"avatar_url":"/avatars/vramesh-100.png","invited_by_user":"sqs","github_username":"rameshvarun"},"tags":["javascript"]},{"short_id":"dby2to","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dby2to","created_at":"2023-08-24T13:34:05.000-05:00","title":"Making NetBSD Multiboot-Compatible (2007)","url":"https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/making-netbsd-multiboot-compatible.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dby2to/making_netbsd_multiboot_compatible_2007","submitter_user":{"username":"jmmv","created_at":"2020-08-18T09:08:21.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":98,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jmmv-100.png","invited_by_user":"sevan"},"tags":["netbsd"]},{"short_id":"eaj95e","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/eaj95e","created_at":"2023-08-24T13:26:23.000-05:00","title":"Is Computer Hacking a Crime (1989)","url":"https://faculty.weber.edu/apainter1/Readings/Hacking%20a%20Crime.pdf","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following forum is based on a discussion held on the WELL, a computer bulletin-board system based in Sausalito, California.
