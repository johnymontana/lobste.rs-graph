The result is a powerful alternative to frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte as well as toolchains like Vite, Next.js, and Astro.\r\n\r\nNue ecosystem is work-in-progress and today I'm releasing the tiny, but powerful core: Nue JS. It's an extremely small (2.3kb minzipped) JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's like React or Vue, but there are no hooks, effects, props, or other unusual abstractions on your way. Know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and you can build server-side components and reactive interfaces with ease.\r\n\r\nAll projects will be released under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/goxx8g/nue_react_vue_vite_astro_alternative","submitter_user":{"username":"tipiirai","created_at":"2019-03-31T14:05:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":23,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tipiirai-100.png","invited_by_user":"ondreian"},"tags":["javascript","nodejs","show","web"]},{"short_id":"tzbluo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tzbluo","created_at":"2023-09-14T05:28:07.000-05:00","title":"Goodbye etcd, Hello PostgreSQL: Running Kubernetes with an SQL Database","url":"https://martinheinz.dev/blog/100","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tzbluo/goodbye_etcd_hello_postgresql_running","submitter_user":{"username":"avestura","created_at":"2023-06-21T15:24:27.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"We must know.
