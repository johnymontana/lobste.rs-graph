Its source code\nserves as a good introduction to X11 programming. It is short, simple and easy to follow, as it\naccounts only for a single system – NetBSD. It makes use of both Xt (X toolkit intrinsics) and\nXm (Motif), two of the most popular X libraries. It demonstrates how to access resources from\n˜/.Xdefaults, how to display text in various colors and fonts and how to set timers outside of the\nmain event loop to perform asynchronous tasks that are not triggered by user interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis document is a commented version of the xbattext source code. It is generated with\nref,areference-based literate programming system available at \u003ca href=\"http://git.ankarstrom.se/ref/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttp://git.ankarstrom.se/ref/\u003c/a\u003e.
