Very, very much dislike it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to switch to Chrome for iPad, but it lacks the feature to make the text on web sites larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the web sites I regularly visit, Lobsters has, by far, the smallest font. Too small for me to see on my iPad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there a way to increase the font size on Lobsters in general (outside of the browser)? Perhaps some super duper secret bat-cave setting somewhere on Lobsters itself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/4ow7ed/how_do_i_make_lobsters_font_size_bigger","submitter_user":{"username":"Teckla","created_at":"2016-08-16T13:59:33.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":629,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Teckla-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx"},"tags":["ask","meta"]},{"short_id":"djdrpe","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/djdrpe","created_at":"2021-09-29T09:54:18.000-05:00","title":"Fixing a Security Bug by Changing a Function Signature","url":"https://blog.mozilla.org/attack-and-defense/2021/09/29/fixing-a-security-bug-by-changing-a-function-signature/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/djdrpe/fixing_security_bug_by_changing_function","submitter_user":{"username":"freddyb","created_at":"2017-02-02T09:12:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Security.
