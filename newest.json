Lately we have had a steady stream of popular articles about \u003ccode\u003enix\u003c/code\u003e. These were tagged with \u003ccode\u003elinux\u003c/code\u003e or the even broader \u003ccode\u003eunix\u003c/code\u003e tag. To be able to filter them out, it would be nice to have that tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent stories that are about nix:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/npofl0/my_vr_hell_on_nixos\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/npofl0/my_vr_hell_on_nixos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/ypwgwp/tvix_we_are_rewriting_nix\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/ypwgwp/tvix_we_are_rewriting_nix\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/tppcqo/nixos_21_11_released\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/tppcqo/nixos_21_11_released\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/65xymz/will_nix_overtake_docker\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/65xymz/will_nix_overtake_docker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/mu95rt/my_homelab_nas_on_nixos\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/mu95rt/my_homelab_nas_on_nixos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/xi9jcs/nixos_headless_home_assistant_vm\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/xi9jcs/nixos_headless_home_assistant_vm\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/weg73v/remote_encrypted_zfs_storage_server_with\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/weg73v/remote_encrypted_zfs_storage_server_with\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/lf069i/nix_template_make_creating_nix\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/lf069i/nix_template_make_creating_nix\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are just from the last 10 days.
