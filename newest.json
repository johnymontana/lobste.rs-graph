At 2023-01-30 and after 20 years providing [pkgsrc.se](https://pkgsrc.se) and other service they decided it was time to say goodbye.\r\n\r\nRead more details at [netbsd.se](https://netbsd.se).\r\n\r\nBecause it's such an awesome service it was not possible for the NetBSD and pkgsrc community to live without it. So the service will continue from [pkgsrc.pub](https://pkgsrc.pub).\r\n\r\nAgain I would like to thank Fredrik and Viktor for all their work providing pkgsrc.se as a real community service over the last 20 years. It’s still a great honour to continue the service in the\r\nsame name.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/penigb/pkgsrc_se_is_back_online","submitter_user":{"username":"tm","created_at":"2015-02-02T13:30:46.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"As Ninja - known as system administrator - I mostly focus on web services, monitoring and server automatization.
