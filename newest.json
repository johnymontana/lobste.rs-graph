Window-breaking does not necessarily occur on a large scale because some areas are inhabited by determined window-breakers whereas others are populated by window-lovers; rather, one unrepaired broken window is a signal that no one cares, and so breaking more windows costs nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this is interesting; the impact of such psychology is still very much prevalent and wide-ranging. Complacence breeds incompetence, incompetence leads to neglect, and neglect eventually results in the failure of systems. When people stop caring about the things they value, eventually other people mirror the same.\r\n\r\nInteractive communities wither away when people stop showing up, relationships go sour when one person stops caring, businesses go bust when they stop innovating their products, and code-quality eventually degrades when software-engineers know that feature delivery is a much valued KPI over general code-quality and optimizaton.\r\n\r\nWhen engineers decide to be lax with the software they write, it is because someone else decided to slack in the first place. This eventually spills over to the rest of the code in the project, and the entropy/chaos in the system keeps increasing over time. Negligence finds a way, and eventually more windows get broken.\r\n\r\nI see three ways to ward-off this 'window-breaking' when it comes to software:\r\n\r\n- Set **Benchmarks** \u0026 Standards. For setting pole-stars for the project. Templates and guardrails.\r\n- **Incentivize**. Reward clean and optimized code now over bug-fixing it later. Avoid the cobra effect.\r\n- Tight **Feedback Loops**. Avoid buildups of both emotions and poor code. Let others know of poor-quality immediately rather than complain about it later.\r\n\r\nWhen engineers start taking ownership of their code like proactive members of a nice neighbourhood, the occurances of crimes-against-code or window-breakings will go down as well, and more people would like to be a part of your community.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8racnc/broken_windows_software","submitter_user":{"username":"aayush","created_at":"2018-04-17T02:05:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"`Excited by how technology can transform lives, connect people, influence relationships, empower communities, propel humanity and create a better planet. 26.`","is_moderator":false,"karma":51,"avatar_url":"/avatars/aayush-100.png","invited_by_user":"yumaikas","github_username":"aayushjain","twitter_username":"aayushjain","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"aayushjain","sig_hash":"694315e93f2b10c4b760b2ac31cf3a5a3fd22315286d15e82d195a5f927add830f"}]},"tags":["compsci","philosophy"]},{"short_id":"8vetn9","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8vetn9","created_at":"2022-11-21T11:31:57.000-06:00","title":"Dittytoy - Music / Synths / Audio FX with JS","url":"https://dittytoy.net/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8vetn9/dittytoy_music_synths_audio_fx_with_js","submitter_user":{"username":"thev","created_at":"2019-03-15T05:18:52.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://showsync.com\r\nhttp://arttech.nl","is_moderator":false,"karma":454,"avatar_url":"/avatars/thev-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson"},"tags":["javascript"]},{"short_id":"yjdu27","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yjdu27","created_at":"2022-11-21T11:25:05.000-06:00","title":"Commodore LCD portable recreation project","url":"http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/projects/clcd/index.html","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yjdu27/commodore_lcd_portable_recreation","submitter_user":{"username":"classichasclass","created_at":"2018-11-05T18:45:47.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"no you're off topic","is_moderator":false,"karma":2620,"avatar_url":"/avatars/classichasclass-100.png","invited_by_user":"sevan"},"tags":["hardware","historical"]}]
