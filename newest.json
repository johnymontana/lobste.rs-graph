It seems that lately attackers are more successful by targeting administrators or developers than attacking the actual deployments and servers.  Meanwhile some attacks social engineer employees into credential theft or reset, other attacks go after operational credentials that are used in semi-automated operations or development scripts.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I don't want to focus on the issue of secure online credential management (I hope we all use some form of password manager), or the security of online authentication protocols (even OAuth seems to be lacking), or the security of MFAs, not even the security of cloud API keys that are actively used by unattended running services (if the attacker has compromised the actual server he most likely already has access to all the sensitive data he wants).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to focus on is those credentials that are used mainly for semi-automated operational or development scripts.  Like for example AWS secret keys used to deploy or to gain access to the underlying buckets or backups;  or passwords used to access the SQL database for maintenance;  or other such secrets that are used outside the browser or specialized applications like SSH.\r\n\r\nAlso, let's assume we are speaking in the context of a small company with at most 10 employees.  Large companies probably have 10 people on the security team tasked only with this topic, thus perhaps this problem is solved in more complex ways.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo, how do the administrators and developers in this community manage such secrets when writing semi-automatic scripts?\r\n\r\nI'm interested especially on the following aspects:\r\n* where do you store the secrets?  in plain-text files, protected with GPG or Age, or even Google Drive?\r\n* how do you share the secrets between employees?  just throw the sensitive material in Slack or email?  (can one actually safely remove something from Slack or GMail?)\r\n* how do you dispose of the secrets once they aren't needed (or have been exposed)?  (because if they are in Git, good-luck with that...)\r\n* how do you keep track of what credentials are still required and in use?  `grep`-ing the scripts code for random looking tokens?\r\n* how do you know who has access to what?\r\n* how often, and how do you actually rotate such secrets?  (I admit I don't want to answer this question...)\r\n* how do you actually provide it to the scripts?  via environment variables?  via command line arguments?  via world-readable files in `/tmp`?\r\n* is anyone actually using any of the PKCS#11-related tools out there?\r\n* what if you need to pass such a secret to a tool that runs on a remote system which you access via SSH?  do you just `scp` it to `/tmp`?\r\n* do you use any existing tool for this purpose?  or is everything built in house?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSorry for the lengthy question, but I do wonder about this for some time...","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wi1r4a/how_do_you_securely_manage_secrets","submitter_user":{"username":"ciprian_craciun","created_at":"2022-02-14T13:47:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"IT enthusiast, from programming to operating systems, from networking to cryptography, from cloud to hardware, from Erlang to Java.","is_moderator":false,"karma":602,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ciprian_craciun-100.png","invited_by_user":"syn-ack"},"tags":["ask","security"]},{"short_id":"g0r6i0","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/g0r6i0","created_at":"2023-01-11T16:11:05.000-06:00","title":"Horizon EDA","url":"https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/g0r6i0/horizon_eda","submitter_user":{"username":"pta2002","created_at":"2018-01-29T15:55:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":397,"avatar_url":"/avatars/pta2002-100.png","invited_by_user":"yumaikas","github_username":"pta2002"},"tags":["hardware"]}]
