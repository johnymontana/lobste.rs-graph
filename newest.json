These algorithms are all presented within a common framework that allows them to be driven by the information collected by Rapid Type Analysis, or by some other type analysis algorithm.\u003cbr\u003e\nCollectively, the optimizations in this dissertation free the programmer from having to sacrifice modularity and extensibility for performance. Instead, the programmer can freely make use of the most powerful features of object-oriented programming, since the optimizer will remove unnecessary extensibility from the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wfx5rq/fast_effective_optimization_statically","submitter_user":{"username":"dbremner","created_at":"2012-09-06T19:01:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"C, C++, C#, and recently Python, Swift, and Objective-C.  \r\nLearning Scala.","is_moderator":false,"karma":2094,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dbremner-100.png","invited_by_user":"pushcx","github_username":"dbremner"},"tags":["compilers","pdf"]},{"short_id":"uvxkh5","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uvxkh5","created_at":"2021-08-26T10:41:36.000-05:00","title":"Nix/NixOS package version diff tool","url":"https://gitlab.com/khumba/nvd","score":22,"flags":1,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uvxkh5/nix_nixos_package_version_diff_tool","submitter_user":{"username":"deylami","created_at":"2021-08-12T13:24:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":30,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deylami-100.png","invited_by_user":"badtuple"},"tags":["linux","osdev","programming","unix"]},{"short_id":"bxl9ba","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bxl9ba","created_at":"2021-08-26T08:52:12.000-05:00","title":"prettymaps: A small set of Python functions to draw pretty maps from OpenStreetMap data","url":"https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps","score":25,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bxl9ba/prettymaps_small_set_python_functions","submitter_user":{"username":"learnbyexample","created_at":"2020-06-15T09:51:10.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Sundeep Agarwal is a freelance trainer, [author](https://learnbyexample.github.io/books/) and mentor.
